# FRC Robotics Scouting App

The following directory is the source code for the Scouting App created by the [FEDS 201](https://www.feds201.com/) FRC robotics team
out of Rochester High School.

## Description

A feature-packed FRC Scouting App for all your Scouting needs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone our project using your preferred IDE
2. Ensure the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) LTS version is installed by running `node -v` in any terminal
3. Run `choco install -y nodejs` to install Node.
4. Run `npm install` in the project directory via terminal to install dependencies

### Dependencies

- Windows or Linux Device to run Android version of the app
- Mac with Xcode installed (To run the IOS version of the app)
- Android Studio if you are using an Emulator to run Android
- Check package.json for project dependencies

### Installing

- The Bundled app will be on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store

## Executing The App

This Project utilizes [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/), a React Native framework, to deploy the app.

- **Do not use Expo Go to run this app**
- **Development builds cannot be scanned with QR using the Expo Go app**

### Android Run Instructions

Android Studio is required to create development builds in react native.

- Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- Run `choco install -y microsoft-openjdk11` in the terminal (This app utilizes Expo SDK 49, which uses JDK 11)
- You will also need to install [Android SDK](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-development/)
- Ensure your Windows [Environment Variables](https://developer.android.com/tools/variables#envar) has a [path called ANDROID_HOME](https://developer.android.com/tools/variables) directed to the SDK folder
- To set up an Emulator visit [Expo's Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/).
- To use a local Android device, ensure the device is plugged in with [USB debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) enabled.

- **Build Project with Expo CLI**

1. Run `npx expo install expo-dev-client` (Converts react native code to native android code) [learn more](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/#what-is-expo-dev-client)
2. Create a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/).
3. Run `npx expo start` in terminal
4. Switch to Development Build, and run Android

- **Build Project Locally (Native Files)**

1. Run `npx expo run:android` (This will start installing gradle and native android dependencies)
2. Switch to Development Build, and run Android

### IOS Run Instructions
