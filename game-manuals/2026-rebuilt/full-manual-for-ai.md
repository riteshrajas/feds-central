## In Memoriam

In October 2019, Dr. Woodie Flowers, an innovator in design and
engineering education and a Distinguished Advisor to *FIRST* and
supporter of our mission, passed away. As thousands of heartfelt
tributes to Woodie have poured in from around the world, it is clear his
legacy will live on indefinitely through the gracious nature of our
community and our ongoing commitment to empowering educators and
building global citizens.

Dr. Woodie Flowers, 1943-2019

## *FIRST*^®^ Robotics Competition 

*FIRST*^®^ Robotics Competition combines the excitement of sport with
the rigors of science and technology. Teams of students are challenged
to design, build, and program industrial-size robots and compete for
awards, while they also create a team identity, raise funds, hone
teamwork skills, and advance respect and appreciation for STEM within
the local community.

Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each
team. It's as close to real-world engineering as a student can get.
Plus, high school students gain access to exclusive scholarship
opportunities from colleges, universities, and technical programs.

Each January at an event known as "Kickoff," a new, challenging game is
introduced. These exciting competitions combine the practical
application of science and technology with the fun, intense energy, and
excitement of a championship-style sporting event. Teams are encouraged
to display *Gracious Professionalism*^®^, help other teams, and
cooperate while competing. This is known as *Coopertition*^®^.

In 2026, *FIRST* Robotics Competition is projected to reach
approximately 90,000 high-school students representing more than 3,700
teams. Teams represent more than 30 countries and come from nearly every
state in the United States.

*FIRST* Robotics Competition teams will participate in 56 Regional
Competitions, 125 District Competitions, and 15 District Championships.
In addition, approximately 600 teams will qualify to attend the *FIRST*
Championship in April 2026.

This year's game, and this manual, were presented at the 2026 *FIRST*
Robotics Competition Kickoff on Saturday, January 10, 2026. At the
Kickoff, all teams:

- saw the 2026 game, REBUILT^TM^ presented by Haas, for the first time,

- learned about the 2026 game rules and regulations, and

- received a set of game specific materials.

## *FIRST* Ethos and Core Values

### Core Values

The *FIRST* Core Values are fundamental to *FIRST* and unique to its
programs. They emphasize friendly sportsmanship, respect for the
contributions of others, teamwork, learning, and community involvement
and are part of our commitment to fostering, cultivating, and preserving
a culture of unity.

Our community expresses the *FIRST* philosophies of *Gracious
Professionalism*^®^ and *Coopertition*^®^ through the *FIRST* Core
Values.

> **Discovery**: We explore new skills and ideas.
>
> **Innovation**: We use creativity and persistence to solve problems.
>
> **Impact**: We apply what we learn to improve our world.
>
> **Inclusion**: We respect each other and embrace our differences.
>
> **Teamwork**: We are stronger when we work together.
>
> **Fun**: We enjoy and celebrate what we do!

### *Gracious Professionalism*^®^*,* a *FIRST* Credo

*Gracious Professionalism* is part of the ethos of *FIRST*. It's a way
of doing things that encourages high quality work, emphasizes the value
of others, and respects individuals and the community. *Gracious
Professionalism* is not clearly defined for a reason. It is an
aspirational ideal to always strive towards, not a goal to be achieved
or a method of measuring someone, and for this reason, you can never say
someone "is" or "is not" being Graciously Professional. We should each
work to better embody *Gracious Professionalism* in all our actions. How
we pursue this can and should mean different things to everyone.

Some possible meanings of *Gracious Professionalism* include:

- gracious attitudes and behaviors are win-win,

- gracious folks respect others and let that respect show in their
  actions,

- professionals possess special knowledge and are trusted by society to
  use that knowledge responsibly, and

- gracious professionals make a valued contribution in a manner pleasing
  to others and to themselves.

In the context of *FIRST*, this means that all teams and participants
should:

- learn to be strong competitors, but also treat one another with
  respect and kindness in the process and

- avoid leaving anyone feeling as if they are excluded or unappreciated.

Knowledge, pride, and empathy should be comfortably and genuinely
blended.

In the end, *Gracious Professionalism* is part of pursuing a meaningful
life. When professionals use knowledge in a gracious manner and
individuals act with integrity and sensitivity, everyone wins and
society benefits.

exemplar</p></figcaption>
</figure>

"The FIRST spirit encourages doing high-quality, well-informed work in a
manner that leaves everyone feeling valued. Gracious Professionalism
seems to be a good descriptor for part of the ethos of FIRST. It is part
of what makes FIRST different and wonderful."

\- Dr. Woodie Flowers, (1943 -- 2019)

Distinguished Advisor to FIRST

It is a good idea to spend time going over this concept with your team
and reinforcing it regularly. We recommend providing your team with
real-life examples of *Gracious Professionalism* in practice, such as
when a team loans valuable materials or expertise to another team that
they will later face as an opponent in competition. Routinely highlight
opportunities to display *Gracious Professionalism* at events and
encourage team members to suggest ways in which they can demonstrate
this quality themselves and through outreach activities.

### *Coopertition*^®^

At *FIRST*, *Coopertition* is displaying unqualified kindness and
respect in the face of fierce competition. *Coopertition* is founded on
the concept and philosophy that teams can and should help and cooperate
with one another even as they compete. *Coopertition* involves learning
from teammates and mentors. *Coopertition* means competing always but
assisting and enabling others when you can.

**Message from Woodie Flowers Award Recipients**

The Woodie Flowers Award is the most prestigious mentoring award in
FIRST. The award recipients created an important message for all FIRST
Robotics Competition teams to consider as we tackle each season.

Performing at your best is important. Winning is important. This is a
competition.

However, winning with Gracious Professionalism and being proud of what
you have accomplished and how you have accomplished it is more
important. FIRST could create rules and penalties to cover almost any
scenario or situation, but we prefer an understandable game with simpler
rules that allow us to think and be creative in our designs.

We want to know that our partners and opponents are playing at their
best in every MATCH. We want to know they are playing with integrity and
not using strategies based on questionable behaviors.

As you create your ROBOTS and award presentations, prepare for
competition and MATCH play, create and implement game strategies, and
live your daily lives, remember what Woodie said time and time again,
and let's 'Make your Grandmother proud.'

## This Document & Its Conventions

The 2026 Game Manual is a resource for all *FIRST* Robotics Competition
teams for information specific to the 2026 season and the REBUILT game.
Its audience will find the following detail:

- a general overview of the REBUILT game,

- detail about the REBUILT playing FIELD,

- a description of how to play the REBUILT game,

- rules (related to safety, conduct, game play, inspection, event,
  etc.), and

- a description of how teams advance at 2026 tournaments and throughout
  the season.

The intent of this manual is that the text means exactly, and only, what
it says. Please avoid interpreting the text based on assumptions about
intent, implementation of past rules, or how a situation might be in
"real life." There are no hidden requirements or restrictions. If you've
read everything, you know everything.

Specific methods are used throughout this manual to highlight warnings,
cautions, key words, and phrases. These conventions are used to alert
the reader to important information and are intended help teams in
constructing a ROBOT that complies with the rules in a safe manner.

Links to other section headings in this manual, external articles, and
rule references appear in [blue underlined text]{.underline}.

Key words that have a particular meaning within the context of the
*FIRST* Robotics Competition and REBUILT are defined in the
[[Glossary]{.underline}](#glossary) and indicated in ALL CAPS throughout
this document.

The rule numbering method indicates the section, subsection, and
position of the rule within that subsection. The letter indicates the
section in which the rule is published.

- Q for [6.7.1 Question Box (Q)]{.underline}

<!-- -->

- G for [7 [Game Rules (G)](#_Game_Rules_(G))]{.underline}

- R for [8 [ROBOT Construction Rules
  (R)](#robot-construction-rules-r)]{.underline}

- I for [9 Inspection & Eligibility (I)]{.underline}

- T for [10 Tournaments (T)]{.underline}

- C for [13 FIRST Championship Tournament (C)]{.underline}

- E for [14 Event Rules (E)]{.underline}

The following digit(s) represents the subsection in which the rule can
be found. The final digits indicate the rule's position within that
subsection.

style="width:4.5in;height:1.54334in"
alt="Diagram showing rule numbering method with identifiers for each digit." />
<figcaption><p>Rule numbering method</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Warnings, cautions, and notes appear in blue boxes. Pay close attention
to their contents as they're intended to provide insight into the
reasoning behind a rule, helpful information on understanding or
interpreting a rule, and/or possible "best practices" for use when
implementing systems affected by a rule.

While blue boxes are part of the manual, they do not carry the weight of
the actual rule (if there is an inadvertent conflict between a rule and
its blue box, the rule supersedes the language in the blue box).

Imperial dimensions are followed by comparable metric dimensions in
parentheses to provide metric users with the approximate size, mass,
etc. Decimal values are rounded in order to limit the number of decimal
places shown and the number of significant figures. Metric conversions
in rules round such that the metric dimension is compliant with the rule
(i.e. maximums round down, minimums round up). The metric conversions
are offered for convenient reference only and do not overrule or take
the place of the imperial dimensions presented in this manual and the
official drawings (i.e. dimensions and rules will always defer to
measurements using imperial units).

Rules include colloquial language, also called headlines, in an effort
to convey an abbreviated version of the rule or rule set. There are two
versions of headline formatting.

Evergreen rules, or rules which are expected to go relatively unchanged
from season to season, are indicated with a leading asterisk and their
rule number and headline are presented in **bold green text**.
"Relatively unchanged" means that the overall intent and presence of the
rule from season to season is constant, but game specific terms may be
updated as needed (e.g. changing Power Cells to FUEL in a rule about
what COACHES may not contact during a MATCH). These rules also start
their respective section, so their rule number is not expected to change
from season to season.

All other rule headlines use **bold blue text**. Any disagreement
between the specific language used in the rules and the colloquial
language is an error, and the specific rule language is the ultimate
authority. If you discover a disparity, please let us know at
[[customerservice@firstinspires.org]{.underline}](mailto:customerservice@firstinspires.org)
and we will correct it.

Team resources that aren't generally season specific (e.g., what to
expect at an event, communication resources, team organization

## Team Updates

Team Updates are used to notify the *FIRST* Robotics Competition
community of revisions to the official season documentation (e.g. the
manual, drawings, etc.) or important season news. Team Update posts are
scheduled as follows:

- each Tuesday and Friday, starting on the first Tuesday after Kickoff
  and ending on the Tuesday prior to Week 1 events

- each Tuesday, starting Week 1 and ending the week after the final
  District Championship events.

Team Updates are posted on the [[Season Materials
webpage]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/resources/library/frc/season-materials)
and are generally posted before 5 pm, Eastern.

Generally, Team Updates follow the following convention:

- Additions are highlighted in yellow. [This is an example.]{.mark}

- Deletions are indicated with a strikethrough. ~~This is an example.~~

## Question and Answer System

The [[Question and Answer System
(Q&A)]{.underline}](https://frc-qa.firstinspires.org/) is a resource for
clarifying the [[2026 REBUILT Game
Manual]{.underline}](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2026/Manual/2026FRCGameManual.pdf),
[[Award]{.underline}[s
webpag]{.underline}[es]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/resources/library/frc/awards),
[[official FIELD
drawings]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/resources/library/frc/playing-field),
and/or [[District and Regional Events
webpage]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/resources/library/frc/district-regional-events)
content. Teams can search for previously asked questions and responses
or pose new questions. Questions can include examples for clarity or
reference multiple rules to understand the relationships and differences
between them.

The Q&A opens on January 14, 2026, 12:00 PM Eastern. Details on the Q&A
can be found on the [[Season Materials
webpage]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/resources/library/frc/season-materials).
The Q&A may result in revisions to the text in the official manuals
(which are communicated using the process described in Team Updates).

The responses in the Q&A do not supersede the text in the manual,
although every effort will be made to eliminate inconsistencies between
the two. While responses provided in the Q&A may be used to aid
discussion at each event, per section [9 Inspection &
Eligibility]{.underline} and section [6.7 Head REFEREE and FTA
Interaction]{.underline}, REFEREES and INSPECTORS are the ultimate
authority on rules. If you have concerns about enforcement trends by
volunteer authorities, please notify *FIRST* at
[<customerservice@firstinspires.org>.]{.underline}

The Q&A is not a resource for firm predictions on how a situation will
play out an event. Questions about the following will not be addressed:

- rulings on vague situations,

- challenging decisions made at past events, or

- design reviews of a ROBOT system for legality.

Weak questions are overly broad, vague, and/or include no rule
references. Some examples of questions that will not be answered in the
Q&A are:

- Is this part/design legal?

- How should the REFEREE have ruled when this specific game play
  happened?

- Duplicate questions

- Nonsense questions

Good questions ask generically about features of parts or designs,
gameplay scenarios, or rules, and often reference one or more relevant
rules within the question. Some examples of questions that will likely
be answered in the Q&A are:

- A device we are considering using on the ROBOT comes with purple AWG
  40 wire, does this comply with R?? and R??

- We're not sure how to interpret how Rule G?? applies if blue ROBOT A
  does X and red ROBOT B does Y, can you please clarify?

- If a ROBOT does this specific action, is it doing what this defined
  term is describing?

Questions from "FRC 99999" represent content asked by key volunteers
(e.g., REFEREES, INSPECTORS, etc.), answered by *FIRST*, and are
considered relevant to teams.

# Game Sponsor Recognition

Thank you to the 2026 *FIRST*^®^ Robotics Competition season presenting
sponsor, the [[Gene Haas
Foundation]{.underline}](https://ghaasfoundation.org/content/ghf/en/home.html).

In REBUILT^TM^ presented by Haas, two competing alliances are invited to
score fuel, cross obstacles, and climb the tower before time runs out.
Alliances earn additional rewards for meeting specific scoring
thresholds.

During the first 20 seconds of the match, robots are autonomous. Without
guidance from their drivers, robots score fuel into their hub. Fuel can
be pre-loaded into a robot, obtained from the human player, collected at
the depot, or picked up throughout the center of the field. Some robots
may also climb the tower to obtain additional points.

During the remaining 2 minutes and 20 seconds, drivers control their
robots. Based on the result of autonomous play, alliance hubs will
alternate between active and inactive, shifting gameplay between both
sides of the field. Robots can collect fuel at any point in the match
and may control any amount of fuel at a time. Drivers control their
robots to score fuel into their hub while it is active and may perform
defensive strategies or collect more fuel while their hub is inactive.

As time runs out, all hubs become active, allowing all robots to score.
Robots can climb to the tower's highest heights to score additional
points and claim match bonuses to increase their position in the
rankings.

The alliance that earns the most points wins the match!

# ARENA 

The ARENA includes all elements of the game infrastructure that are
required to play REBUILT^TM^ presented by Haas: the FIELD, SCORING
ELEMENTS, queue area, team media area (when available), designated
TECHNICIAN area, and all equipment needed for FIELD control, ROBOT
control, and scorekeeping.

## Dimensions and Accuracy

All official models for the REBUILT FIELD were created in Onshape.

![](./game-manual/media/media/image17.png){width="2.5596839457567806in"
height="0.8962259405074365in"}

The specification for the REBUILT FIELD can be retrieved from a few
locations:

- The 3D CAD model is the official representation of the REBUILT FIELD
  and how it is constructed.

- Illustrations included in this section are for a general visual
  understanding of the REBUILT ARENA, and dimensions included in the
  manual are nominal and no tolerances are implied. Please refer to the
  official drawings for exact dimensions, tolerances, and construction
  details.

- The [[Field Dimension
  Drawings]{.underline}](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2026/FieldAssets/2026-field-dimension-dwgs.pdf)
  package has critical dimensions for each FIELD element.

- The FIELD Manual (coming soon) includes instructions on how to build
  the FIELD along with showing the ways construction type will influence
  the field tolerances. It also includes many of the key dimensions
  which are listed in the Official FIELD Drawings.

- The FIELD Acceptance Checklist (coming soon) includes the controlled
  dimensions (with relevant tolerances) which will be checked by event
  staff a few times throughout the event. The FIELD is expected to
  change during MATCH play. Teams can ask the FTA to re-check specific
  measurements if they believe something is out of spec prior to a MATCH
  beginning.

The official drawings, CAD models, and drawings for low-cost versions of
important elements of the REBUILT FIELD are posted on [[the Playing
FIELD
webpage]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/playing-field).

The ARENA is modular and assembled, used, disassembled, and shipped many
times during the competition season. It undergoes wear and tear. The
ARENA is designed to withstand rigorous play and frequent shipping.
Every effort is made to ensure that ARENAS are consistent from event to
event.

However, ARENAS are assembled in different venues by different event
staff and some small variations occur. Successful teams will design
ROBOTS that are insensitive to these variations.

## FIELD

Each FIELD for REBUILT is an approximately 317.7in (\~8.07m) by 651.2in
(\~16.54m) carpeted area bounded by inward facing surfaces of the
ALLIANCE WALLS, OUTPOSTS, TOWER WALLS, and guardrails.

FIELD boundary in pink

> ![Overhead view of field showing FIELD
> boundary](./game-manual/media/media/image18.png){width="6.645844269466317in"
> height="3.6416666666666666in"}

The FIELD is populated with and surrounded by the following elements:

- 1 OUTPOST per ALLIANCE,

- 1 HUB per ALLIANCE,

- 1 TOWER per ALLIANCE,

- 2 DEPOTS,

- 4 BUMPS, and

- 4 TRENCHES.

The surface of the FIELD is low pile carpet, Shaw Floors, Philadelphia
Commercial, Neyland II 20, "66561 Medallion." Neyland II carpet is not
available for purchase at this time, and the closest equivalent is
[[Shaw, Philadelphia Brand, Profusion 20, Style
54933]{.underline}](https://philadelphiacommercial.com/products/carpet/details/profusion-20/54933/plethora/00520);
see results from evaluation in [[this blog
post]{.underline}](https://community.firstinspires.org/2023-carpet-at-2024-events).

Carpet edges and seams are secured with [[3M^TM^ Premium
M]{.underline}[atte Cloth (Gaffers) Tape GT2, GT3 or comparable Gaffer's
Tape]{.underline}](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b40065992/). Tears,
rips, and damage to the carpet may be repaired with the same styles of
tape and ROBOTS must be prepared to operate on surfaces made of carpet,
tape, or combinations of both materials as repairs are made through the
course of competition.

Guardrails form the long edges of the FIELD. Guardrails are a 20.0in
(50.8cm) tall system of transparent polycarbonate supported on the top
and bottom by aluminum extrusion. There are 4 gates in the guardrail
that allow access to the FIELD for placement and removal of ROBOTS. The
gate passthrough, when open, is 38.0in (96.5cm) wide. Gates are closed
and shielded during the MATCH.

style="width:5.56101in;height:3.04722in"
alt="Overhead view of FIELD showing gate locations" />
<figcaption><p>Gate locations</p></figcaption>
</figure>

There are 2 versions of guardrails and DRIVER STATIONS used for
competitions. 1 design is the Welded FIELD which is reflected in the
[[2026 Official *FIRST* FIELD Drawings &
Models](https://www.firstinspires.org/resources/library/frc/playing-field).]{.underline}
The other is designed and sold by AndyMark. [Table 5‑1]{.underline} and

[Table 5‑2]{.underline} illustrate which areas have each kind of FIELD.
While the designs are slightly different, the critical dimensions,
performance, and expected user experience between them are the same
unless otherwise noted. Detailed drawings for the AndyMark design are
posted on the [[AndyMark
website]{.underline}](https://www.andymark.com/products/andymark-field-perimeter).
All illustrations in this manual show the traditional Welded FIELD
design.

- **ALLIANCE AREA**: an approximately 360in wide by 134in deep (\~9.14m
  by 3.4m) infinitely tall volume formed by, and including the ALLIANCE
  WALL, OUTPOST, TOWER WALL, the edge of the carpet, and ALLIANCE
  colored tape perpendicular to the DRIVER STATIONS.

- **ALLIANCE ZONE**: A 158.6in deep by 317.7in long (\~4.03m by 8.07m),
  infinitely tall volume formed by an ALLIANCE WALL, TOWER WALL, and
  guardrails. It surrounds an ALLIANCE TOWER and a DEPOT. It is bounded
  by and includes the ROBOT STARTING LINE.

- **CENTER LINE**: a white line that spans the width of the FIELD that
  bisects the NEUTRAL ZONE in half.

- **NEUTRAL ZONE**: A 283in deep by 317.7in long (7.19m by 8.07m),
  infinitely tall volume formed by the BUMPS, TRENCHES, HUBS, and
  guardrails. It surrounds and includes the CENTER LINE.

- **HUMAN STARTING LINE**: a white line spanning the ALLIANCE AREA up to
  the OUTPOST AREA that is parallel to and located 24.0in (61.0cm) from
  the bottom square tube of the ALLIANCE WALL to the near edge of the
  tape.

- **OUTPOST AREA**: a 71.0in wide by 134in deep (1.8m by 3.4m)
  infinitely tall volume bounded by the OUTPOST, edge of carpet, and
  ALLIANCE and white colored tape.

- **ROBOT STARTING LINE**: an ALLIANCE colored line that spans the width
  of the FIELD at the edge of an ALLIANCE'S BASE in front of two
  BARRIERS and an ALLIANCE HUB.

## HUB

<figure>

style="width:3.29167in;height:3.42377in" alt="Image of the HUB" />
<figcaption><p>HUB</p></figcaption>
</figure>

A HUB is one of two 47in by 47in (\~1.19m by 1.19m) rectangular prism
structures with an extended opening at the top surface. Each ALLIANCE
has a dedicated HUB centered between two BUMPS located 158.6in (\~4.03m)
away from their ALLIANCE WALL. Each HUB has a set of exits that randomly
distributes FUEL into the NEUTRAL ZONE. A net structure located in the
back of the HUB prevents FUEL launched from most prohibited areas from
entering the opening.

style="width:3.56578in;height:3.33333in"
alt="Image showing distance from the wall to the HUB" />
<figcaption><p>: HUB distance to the ALLIANCE WALL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

The top of each HUB has a 41.7in (\~1.06m) hexagonal opening into which
ROBOTS can deliver FUEL. The front edge of the opening is 72in (\~1.83m)

HUBS have a series of exits at the base of the HUB facing towards the
NEUTRAL ZONE. FUEL processed through the HUB are distributed into the
NEUTRAL ZONE via one of four exits as shown in [Figure 5‑8]{.underline}.
Examples of FUEL distribution from the HUB can be found on the [[Playing
FIELD
webpage]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/resources/library/frc/playing-field).

<figcaption><p>: TRENCH</p></figcaption>
</figure>

TRENCHES are a 65.65in (1.668m) wide, 47.0in (1.194m) deep, and 40.25in
(1.022m) tall structure that ROBOTS drive underneath. The TRENCH extends
from the guardrail to the BUMP on both sides of the FIELD. The space
underneath each TRENCH arm is 50.34in (1.279m) wide, 22.25in (56.52cm)
tall.

TRENCHES along the guardrail closest to the scoring table contain
additional electronics to reach the HUB. The TRENCHES along the
guardrail furthest from the scoring table have a pivot arm that allows
the horizontal portion of the TRENCH to rotate into a vertical position
for post-MATCH ROBOT retrieval and to let FIELD staff reset the field
between matches. The pivot arm will be locked in the horizontal position
during the MATCH.

## DEPOT

A DEPOT is a 42.0in (1.07m) wide, 27.0in (68.6cm) deep structure located
along the ALLIANCE WALL. There is 1 DEPOT per ALLIANCE. DEPOTS are made
up of 3.0in (7.62cm) wide, 1.0in (2.54) tall steel barriers. The DEPOT
is secured to the carpet using hook fastener which increases the height
to approximately 1.125in (2.86cm).

## TOWER

<figure>
<img src="./game-manual/media/media/image28.png"
style="width:3.09375in;height:3.9856in" alt="Image showing TOWER" />
<figcaption><p>: TOWER</p></figcaption>
</figure>

A TOWER is a 49.25in (1.251m) wide, 45.0in (1.143m) deep, and 78.25in
(1.988m) tall structure made up of the TOWER WALL, TOWER BASE, UPRIGHTS,
RUNGS and supporting structures. There is 1 TOWER per ALLIANCE. A TOWER
is integrated into each ALLIANCE WALL between DRIVER STATION 2 and
DRIVER STATION 3.

The TOWER BASE is a 39.0in (99.06cm) wide by 45.18in (1.148m) deep plate
that sits on the floor and extends from the TOWER WALL. The TOWER BASE
is powder-coated steel with hook fastener underneath. The edges of the
TOWER BASE are approximately 0.2in (0.5cm) to 0.3in (0.8cm) tall.

The UPRIGHTS are two 72.1in (1.831m) tall, 1.5in (3.81cm) thick, 3.5in
(8.89cm) deep sheet metal box frames that extend vertically up from the
TOWER BASE. The distance between each UPRIGHT is 32.25in (81.92cm).

The UPRIGHTS hold three horizontal RUNGS made up of 1-1/4in Sch 40
(1.66in (4.216cm) OD) pipe. Each RUNG is centered between the UPRIGHT
and extend 5.875in (14.92cm) from the outer face of the UPRIGHT on
either side. The center of the LOW RUNG is located 27.0in (68.58cm) from
the floor. The center of the MID RUNG is located 45.0in (114.3cm) from
the floor. The center of the HIGH RUNG is 63.0in (1.6m) from the floor.
The RUNGS are 18.0in (45.72cm) apart center to center.

The UPRIGHTS and RUNGS are powder-coated red or blue.

Each TOWER has additional supporting structures extending from the
UPRIGHT to the TOWER WALL between approximately 28.40in (72.14cm) and
43.38in (1.102m) off the floor.

alt="Image showing location of DRIVER STATION and DRIVER STATION dimensions. " />
<figcaption><p>: DRIVER STATION (ALLIANCE AREA perspective and FIELD
perspective)</p></figcaption>
</figure>

A DRIVER STATION is 1 of 3 assemblies within an ALLIANCE WALL behind
which a DRIVE TEAM operates their ROBOT. Each DRIVER STATION is made
from a 36.8in (93.5cm) tall diamond plate base topped with a 42in
(1.07m) tall transparent plastic sheet and a top rail.

An aluminum shelf is attached to each DRIVER STATION to support an
OPERATOR CONSOLE. The shelf is 69in (1.75m) wide and 12.25in (31.1cm)
deep. There is a 54.0in (1.372m) long by 2.0in (nominal) wide strip of
hook-and-loop tape ("loop" side) along the center of the support shelf
that may be used to secure the OPERATOR CONSOLE to the shelf. The shelf
also includes two clips to hold the shelf in place with a 1.0in (2.5cm)
wide by 2.0in (5.1cm) deep tab that sits on the top surface of the
shelf.

There is a 6.0in (15.2cm) tall sponsor panel in each DRIVER STATION. The
top of this panel is 42.9in (1.09m) from the carpet.

There may be a ramp available at events for DRIVE TEAMS with limited
mobility. It is designed to allow an individual using a wheelchair to
access the DRIVER STATION shelf and/or see onto the FIELD; however, this
accommodation is available to anyone who has a wheelchair or other
physical disability that obstructs their view of the FIELD. Teams should
speak to the FTA before MATCHES begin to ensure that it is available for
each of the team's MATCHES.

This ramp is available at many Regional and District events. For
questions, please connect with the local [[Program Delivery
Partner]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/find-local-support).

Teams should also speak to the FTA for any other FIELD side
accommodations needed.

Each DRIVER STATION contains the following elements for DRIVE TEAMS:

- 1 Ethernet cable: attaches to the Ethernet port of the OPERATOR
  CONSOLE and provides connectivity to the FIELD Management System
  (FMS).

- 1 120VAC NEMA 5-15R power outlet (i.e. standard US outlet): located on
  each DRIVER STATION shelf and protected by its own 2-Amp circuit
  breaker. It can be used to power the OPERATOR CONSOLE. DRIVE TEAMS are
  responsible for monitoring their power consumption as a tripped
  breaker in the outlet does not constitute an ARENA FAULT. For some
  events in regions that don't use NEMA 5-15 shaped outlets, event
  organizers may install appropriate plug adapters to be used throughout
  the event.

- 1 Emergency Stop (E-Stop) button: located on the left side of the
  DRIVER STATION shelf and is used to deactivate a ROBOT in an
  emergency.

- 1 Autonomous Stop (A-Stop) button: located on the right side of the
  DRIVER STATION shelf and is used to DISABLE a ROBOT during AUTO.

- 1 team sign: located at the top of each DRIVER STATION. The FIELD
  facing side of the sign displays the team number in the ALLIANCE
  color. The ALLIANCE AREA side of the sign displays the following
  information in red:

  - Pre-MATCH: team number and ROBOT connection state

  - During Qualification MATCHES:

    - Current SHIFT and time remaining in that period,

      - A shows for AUTO when both ALLIANCE's HUBS are active

      - T shows for the TRANSITION SHIFT when both ALLIANCE's HUBS are
        active

      - R shows when the Red ALLIANCE'S HUB is active

      - B shows when the Blue ALLIANCE'S HUB is active

      - E shows for END GAME when both ALLIANCE's HUBS are active

    - Progress towards the FUEL Ranking Points. This shows total scored
      out of the ENERGIZED RP and once that threshold passes it shows
      out of the SUPERCHARGED RP

    - AUTO TOWER points, and

    - remaining MATCH period time.

- 1 timer (in DRIVER STATION 2 only): displays the official time
  remaining in the MATCH period on the FIELD-facing side (in white) and
  on the team facing side the following information in red:

  - remaining MATCH period time, and

  - MATCH scores.

Back of timer

- 1 team LED stack: indicates ALLIANCE color, ROBOT status, E-Stop and
  A-Stop status, and is centered at the top of each DRIVER STATION.

> The stack includes 2 identical ALLIANCE-colored ROBOT status LEDs
> above a third amber A-stop/E-stop LED. LED states are as follows:

- ROBOT status LEDs

  - Solid: indicates that the ROBOT is connected and enabled. This only
    happens during a MATCH.

  - Blinking: indicates that either the FMS is preset for the MATCH and
    the ROBOT is not connected yet, or it's during a MATCH and the
    corresponding ROBOT has lost connectivity, or the E-stop was
    pressed.

  - Off: indicates that the ROBOT is linked and DISABLED prior to the
    start of the MATCH, or the ROBOT is BYPASSED. This light is also
    off, regardless of ROBOT connection status, after the MATCH has
    concluded.

- A-Stop/E-stop LED

  - Solid: the ROBOT is DISABLED due to a press of the team E-stop
    button, the FIELD E-stop button, or by the scorekeeper via the FMS.

  - Blinking: the ROBOT is DISABLED for the remainder of AUTO due to a
    press of the team A-Stop button.

  - Off: the ROBOT is not DISABLED by the FIELD.

- FMS hardware and wiring: mostly located below shelves in the 2 DRIVER
  STATIONS closer to the scoring table.

### OUTPOST

<figure>
<img src="./game-manual/media/media/image35.png"
style="width:2.24009in;height:3.42014in" alt="Image showing OUTPOST" />
<figcaption><p>OUTPOST</p></figcaption>
</figure>

An OUTPOST is an assembly through which HUMAN PLAYERS feed FUEL into the
FIELD and ROBOTS can deliver FUEL to their HUMAN PLAYERS. There are 2
OUTPOSTS, 1 on either end of the FIELD connecting the guardrail to the
ALLIANCE WALL. Each OUTPOST has a 31.8in (80.8cm) wide by 7.0in (17.8cm)
tall opening through which FUEL passes to the FIELD. The bottom of the
opening is 28.1in (71.4cm) off the floor.

A 15.0° sloped tunnel, called the CHUTE, leads to the upper opening in
the OUTPOST. The CHUTE can hold approximately 25 FUEL at a time retained
by the CHUTE DOOR. The CHUTE DOOR is an HDPE arm on a pivot that can be
rotated approximately 90 degrees by the HUMAN PLAYER to open or close
the CHUTE.

At the base of the OUTPOST is an opening 32.0in (81.3cm) wide by 7.0in
(17.8cm) tall where ROBOTS can push FUEL into the CORRAL. The bottom of
the opening is 1.88in (4.77cm) off the ground. The opening is divided in
the center by a vertical 1-1/4in Sch 40 (1.66in (4.216cm) OD) pipe. The
CORRAL is made up of 8.13in (20.6cm) tall polycarbonate panels that
create a 35.8in (90.8cm) wide, 37.6in (95.5cm) deep area on the floor in
which FUEL can be stored.

The CHUTE and CORRAL each feature an ALLIANCE-colored tape line that
indicates where DRIVE TEAMS may be restricted from reaching. The near
edge of the CORRAL tape is 12.7in (32.3cm) from the FIELD-facing wall of
the OUTPOST. The near edge of the CHUTE tape line is 12.9in (32.8cm)
from the FIELD-facing wall of the OUTPOST.

There are 2 stools available at events for DRIVE TEAMS to use. Each
stool is 23.0in (58.42cm) wide by 13.5in (34.29cm) deep, 6.25in
(15.88cm) tall, and rated for 300lb (136.0kg).

It is specially intended to allow individuals who are shorter, better
sightlines onto the FIELD; however, this accommodation is available to
anyone who has another physical disability that obstructs their view of
the FIELD.

Only 2 stools are available, and priority will be given to those with
the biggest need. Teams should speak to the FTA before MATCHES begin to
request that it is available for each of the team's MATCHES. Teams may
also purchase their own ([[Item Number:
779ac01stpm]{.underline}](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/ozark-river-manufacturing-lil-step-booster-6-1-4-maple-wood-childrens-non-slip-step-stool/779AC01STPM.html))
or bring an equivalent (e.g. not foldable and similar dimensions)
version to the event to guarantee use for every match.

This stool is available at all events within the US & Canada and
equivalents are available at international events. For questions, please
connect with the local [[Program Delivery
Partner]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/find-local-support).

## SCORING ELEMENTS

SCORING ELEMENTS are items that teams use to score points. There is one
type of SCORING ELEMENT used in REBUILT: FUEL.

In REBUILT, a ROBOT may CONTROL any number of SCORING ELEMENTS after the
start of the MATCH.

### FUEL

<figure>
<img src="./game-manual/media/media/image36.jpg"
style="width:2.6in;height:2.1938in"
alt="Image showing FUEL, a Yellow sphere with FIRST logo and AndyMark logo. " />
<figcaption><p>FUEL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

A FUEL is a 5.91in (15.0cm) diameter, high density foam ball. FUEL is a
custom made SCORING ELEMENT available for purchase on the AndyMark
website, [[am-5801]{.underline}](https://andymark.com/am-5801).

FUEL has a weight of between 0.448-0.500lb (\~0.203-0.227kg).

FUEL undergoes wear and tear during a competition. Generally, a FUEL
that still appears to look approximately like a FUEL is considered a
FUEL for the purposes of rule evaluation and scoring, whether damaged or
not. Small chunks of a FUEL are not considered a FUEL.

Most new FUEL will have small impressions due to being pressed against
other FUEL or the sides of the packaging during shipping. These
impressions are purely cosmetic and do not affect the function of the
FUEL. Most impressions will gradually disappear as the FUEL is used.

## AprilTags

AprilTags are 8.125in (20.64cm) square targets located on the HUB, TOWER
WALL, OUTPOST, and TRENCHES. There are 32 unique markers on the FIELD
positioned as shown in [Figure 5‑21]{.underline}.

<figure>

</figure>

All markers are from the 36h11 tag family, IDs 1-32. All AprilTags are
mounted to and centered on a 10.5in (26.67cm) square polycarbonate
panel. Each marker has an identifying text label. If AprilTags
experience wear and marking during MATCHES they are repaired with
gaffers tape.

## The FIELD Management System

The FIELD Management System (FMS) is all the electronics responsible for
sensing and controlling the *FIRST* Robotics Competition FIELD. The FMS
encompasses all FIELD electronics, including computers, REFEREE
touchscreens, the wireless access point, sensors, stack lights, A-Stops
and E-Stops, etc.

When a DRIVE TEAM connects the Ethernet cable from their assigned DRIVER
STATION to their OPERATOR CONSOLE, the Driver Station Software on the
OPERATOR CONSOLE computer communicates with FMS. Once connected, the
open ports available are described in [Table 8‑5]{.underline}.

Note that ROBOT code cannot be deployed while connected to the FMS.
Additional information about the FMS may be found in the [[FMS
Whitepaper]{.underline}](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/fms/m/whitepaper/l/608744-fms-whitepaper).

The FMS alerts participants to milestones in the MATCH using audio cues
detailed in [Table 5‑4]{.underline}. Please note that audio cues are
intended as a courtesy to participants and not intended as official
MATCH markers. If there is a discrepancy between an audio cue and the
FIELD timers, the FIELD timers are the authority.

## FIELD STAFF

FIELD STAFF are responsible for making sure the MATCHES are cycled
through efficiently, fairly, safely, and with a spirit of cooperation,
*Gracious Professionalism*, and generosity of spirit. FIELD STAFF roles
are filled by volunteers from the community who prepare for the event
with thorough training and certification. There are 3 FIELD-side key
volunteer roles with whom teams should be familiar and are encouraged to
use as resources to make their event experience valuable (in whatever
way the team defines "valuable").

- **Head REFEREE** -- trains, directs, and supervises REFEREES. They
  oversee all scoring processes and procedures in collaboration with the
  *FIRST* Technical Advisor (FTA). They interact with STUDENTS,
  volunteers, and contracted/*FIRST* staff. The Head REFEREE is
  positioned between the FIELD and the scoring table and wears a yellow
  shirt. The Head REFEREE has final authority for decisions regarding
  MATCH scores, penalties, and YELLOW and RED CARD assignments. For
  additional details, please refer to the [[Head REFEREE role
  description]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/community/volunteers/roles/head-referee).

- ***FIRST* Technical Advisor (FTA)** - ensures events run smoothly,
  safely, and in accordance with *FIRST* requirements. The FTA
  collaborates with *FIRST* staff, event staff, and other event
  volunteers in many different areas at events. The FTA is the liaison
  between *FIRST* HQ and the event for all things related to the FIELD,
  ROBOTS, and game, acts as a team advocate for all teams competing at
  the event and is a major point of escalation and conflict resolution
  for the event. For additional details, please refer to the [[FTA role
  description]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/community/volunteers/roles/first-technical-advisor).

- **FIELD Supervisor** - directs activity on the FIELD to ensure
  efficient execution of the MATCHES, pacing of the event, and smooth
  flow of MATCH play. FIELD Supervisors are responsible for ensuring the
  FIELD is intact and lead FIELD Reset teams, who are responsible for
  resetting the FIELD after each MATCH in preparation for the subsequent
  MATCH. For additional details, please refer to the [[FIELD Supervisor
  role
  description]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/community/volunteers/roles/field-supervisor).

alt="Image showing REBUILT FIELD" />
<figcaption><p>REBUILT</p></figcaption>
</figure>

In REBUILT, 2 ALLIANCES (an ALLIANCE is a cooperative of up to 4 *FIRST*
Robotics Competition teams) play MATCHES, set up and implemented per the
details described below.

## MATCH Overview

MATCHES run on 7--10-minute cycles, which consist of pre-MATCH setup,
the 2-minute and 40-second MATCH, and the post-MATCH reset.

During the MATCH, ROBOTS collect FUEL and score in their HUB. HUMAN
PLAYERS can deliver FUEL to ROBOTS or score them in their HUB.

ROBOTS conclude the MATCH climbing on their TOWER.

## DRIVE TEAM

A DRIVE TEAM is a set of up to 5 people from the same *FIRST* Robotics
Competition team responsible for team performance for a specific MATCH.
There are 4 specific roles on a DRIVE TEAM which ALLIANCES can use to
assist ROBOTS, and no more than 1 member of the DRIVE TEAM may be a
non-STUDENT.

The intent of the definition of DRIVE TEAM and DRIVE TEAM related rules
is that, barring extenuating circumstances, the DRIVE TEAM consists of
people who arrived at the event affiliated with that team and are
responsible for their team's and ROBOT'S performance at the event (this
means a person may be affiliated with more than 1 team).

The intent is not to allow teams to "adopt" members of other teams for
strategic advantage for the loaning team, borrowing team, and/or their
ALLIANCE (e.g. an ALLIANCE CAPTAIN believes 1 of their DRIVERS has more
experience than a DRIVER on their first pick, and the teams agree the
first pick team will "adopt" that DRIVER and make them a member of their
DRIVE TEAM for Playoffs).

The definition isn't stricter for 2 main reasons. First, to avoid
additional bureaucratic burden on teams and event volunteers (e.g.
requiring that teams submit official rosters that Queuing must check
before allowing a DRIVE TEAM into the ARENA). Second, to provide space
for exceptional circumstances that give teams the opportunity to display
*Gracious Professionalism* (e.g. a bus is delayed, a DRIVE COACH has no
DRIVERS, and their pit neighbors agree to help by loaning DRIVERS as
temporary members of the team until their bus arrives).

: DRIVE TEAM roles

A STUDENT is a person who has not completed high-school, secondary
school, or the comparable level as of September 1 prior to Kickoff.

The TECHNICIAN provides teams with a technical resource for pre-MATCH
setup, ROBOT connectivity, OPERATOR CONSOLE troubleshooting, and
post-MATCH removal of the ROBOT. Some pre-MATCH responsibilities for the
TECHNICIAN may include, but are not limited to:

- location of the ROBOT radio, its power connection, and understanding
  of its indicator lights

- location of the roboRIO and understanding of its indicator lights

- username and password for the OPERATOR CONSOLE

- restarting the Driver Station and Dashboard software on the OPERATOR
  CONSOLE

- changing the bandwidth utilization (e.g. camera resolution, frame
  rate, etc.)

- changing a battery

- charging pneumatics

While the TECHNICIAN may be the primary technical member of the DRIVE
TEAM, all members of the DRIVE TEAM are encouraged to have knowledge of
the basic functionality of the ROBOT, such as the location and operation
of the main circuit breaker, connecting and resetting joysticks or
gamepads from the OPERATOR CONSOLE, and removing the ROBOT from the
FIELD.

Per [Table 6‑1]{.underline}, each team is allotted up to 3 STUDENTS who
may be assigned as DRIVERS or HUMAN PLAYERS. If multiple teams on an
ALLIANCE do not have 3 STUDENTS at the event to act in these roles, 1 of
the ALLIANCE'S teams may substitute a STUDENT TECHNICIAN as a HUMAN
PLAYER for that MATCH only. In this case,

- the Head REFEREE must be notified,

- all HUMAN PLAYER rules now apply to this DRIVE TEAM member, and

- this DRIVE TEAM member is no longer considered a TECHNICIAN for that
  MATCH.

## Setup

Before each MATCH begins, FIELD STAFF stage SCORING ELEMENTS as
described in section [6.3.4 SCORING ELEMENTS]{.underline}. DRIVE TEAMS
stage their ROBOTS (as described in section [6.3.3 ROBOTS]{.underline})
and OPERATOR CONSOLES (as described in section [6.3.2 OPERATOR
CONSOLES]{.underline}). Then, DRIVE TEAMS take their places as described
in section [6.3.1 DRIVE TEAMS.]{.underline}

### DRIVE TEAMS 

DRIVE TEAMS prepare for a MATCH by staging in the appropriate areas,
according to their role on the DRIVE TEAM, and by identifying themselves
accordingly. DRIVE TEAM starting conditions are listed below, and a
DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying any of the conditions is at risk of
violating [G301]{.underline}.

A.  only DRIVE TEAM members assigned to the upcoming MATCH are present,

B.  for Qualification MATCHES only DRIVE TEAM members whose ROBOTS have
    passed initial, complete Inspection are present,

C.  any number of HUMAN PLAYERS are staged in their OUTPOST AREAS,

D.  HUMAN PLAYERS not included in C, DRIVERS, and DRIVE COACHES are in
    their ALLIANCE AREA and behind the HUMAN STARTING LINE,

E.  TECHNICIANS are in the event-designated area near the FIELD,

F.  DRIVE TEAM members clearly display their designated buttons above
    their waists (DRIVE COACH - "Drive Coach", DRIVERS and HUMAN
    PLAYERS - "Drive Team", and TECHNICIAN - "Technician"), and

G.  if a Playoff MATCH, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN clearly displays their
    designated ALLIANCE CAPTAIN identifier (e.g. hat or armband).

### OPERATOR CONSOLES

DRIVE TEAMS set up their OPERATOR CONSOLE as soon as the DRIVE TEAM from
the previous MATCH has cleared the area. OPERATOR CONSOLES must be
compliant with all relevant rules, specifically those in section [8.9
OPERATOR CONSOLE]{.underline}. The OPERATOR CONSOLE is plugged into the
team's assigned DRIVER STATION, as indicated on the team sign. Any
control devices worn or held by their HUMAN PLAYERS and/or DRIVERS
during the MATCH must be disconnected from or set on or beside the
OPERATOR CONSOLE before the MATCH can begin. A DRIVE TEAM obstructing or
delaying OPERATOR CONSOLE setup is at risk of violating
[G301]{.underline}.

For the purposes of *FIRST* Robotics Competition, any device connected
to the OPERATOR CONSOLE is considered a control device because REFEREES
are not expected to differentiate between devices that can or cannot
control the ROBOT.

### ROBOTS

DRIVE TEAMS stage their ROBOT in accordance with [G303]{.underline}. A
DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying ROBOT setup requirements is at risk
of violating [G301]{.underline}.

If order of placement matters to either or both ALLIANCES, the ALLIANCE
notifies the Head REFEREE during setup for that MATCH, and the Head
REFEREE instructs ALLIANCES to alternate placement of ROBOTS. In a
Qualification MATCH, REFEREE instructions are that ROBOTS are placed in
the following order:

1.  red DRIVER STATION 1 ROBOT

2.  blue DRIVER STATION 1 ROBOT

3.  red DRIVER STATION 2 ROBOT

4.  blue DRIVER STATION 2 ROBOT

5.  red DRIVER STATION 3 ROBOT

6.  blue DRIVER STATION 3 ROBOT

In an intra-Division Playoff MATCH, the same pattern is applied, but
instead of blue ALLIANCE placing last, the higher seeded ALLIANCE
(regardless of color) places last. For inter-Division Playoff MATCHES,
the ALLIANCE that places last is determined by a (real or virtual) coin
flip facilitated by the Head REFEREE where a "heads" result invites the
red ALLIANCE to place last.

FIELD STAFF may ask teams to indicate their intended location and are
not required to wait for a team to stage their ROBOT in its exact
location before moving to the next team.

### SCORING ELEMENTS

Before each MATCH begins, FIELD STAFF stage SCORING ELEMENTS.

<figure>
<img src="./game-manual/media/media/image44.png"
style="width:6.27333in;height:2.93333in"
alt="Image showing SCORING ELEMENT starting locations on the FIELD." />
<figcaption><p>SCORING ELEMENT staging positions</p></figcaption>
</figure>

504 FUEL are staged for each MATCH as follows (reference [Figure
6‑2]{.underline}):

A.  24 FUEL are staged in each DEPOT (FUEL may not be in a uniform
    layout),

<!-- -->

H.  24 FUEL are staged in each OUTPOST CHUTE,

I.  8 FUEL may be preloaded in each ROBOT by the ROBOT'S DRIVE TEAM,
    such that each FUEL is fully supported by the ROBOT (up to 48 total;
    a FUEL not pre-loaded in a ROBOT is staged in the NEUTRAL ZONE), and

J.  remaining FUEL are arranged in the NEUTRAL ZONE through a process
    listed in Section 6.3.4.1 (360 to 408, depending on how many are
    preloaded in ROBOTS).

Due to the high number of SCORING ELEMENTS in REBUILT, FIELD STAFF may
not be able to perfectly count all FUEL put into the NEUTRAL ZONE. The
number of FUEL staged in the NEUTRAL ZONE for any given match may
fluctuate around +/- 24 FUEL.

For District Championship and/or *FIRST* Championship events, the
quantity of FUEL staged in a MATCH may increase up to 600. If this
happens, the additional FUEL will be included as part of an updated FUEL
arrangement in the NEUTRAL ZONE.

#### NEUTRAL ZONE FUEL ARRANGEMENT

The NEUTRAL ZONE is staged by the FIELD crew by corralling all FUEL
within a bounding box that is approximately 206.0in (5.23m) wide and
72.0in (1.83m) deep. The bounding box has a solid divider in the middle
that is 2.0in (5.08cm) wide that will result in a small gap in FUEL. The
dividers will be removed prior to the start of the MATCH.

<figure>
<img src="./game-manual/media/media/image45.png"
style="width:7.11389in;height:3.96042in"
alt="Image showing NEUTRAL ZONE FUEL setup" />
<figcaption><p>Figure 6‑3 NEUTRAL ZONE FUEL setup</p></figcaption>
</figure>

The expected result of the dispersal is a roughly equal split of FUEL on
both sides of the CENTER LINE. The dispersal between the scoring table
side and non-scoring table side of the field is expected to vary match
to match.

The placement of FUEL in the NEUTRAL ZONE is not intended to be in a
perfect grid. Teams should expect variances in the placement of FUEL in
the NEUTRAL ZONE at the start of the MATCH.

## MATCH Periods

The first period of each MATCH is 20 seconds long and called the
Autonomous Period (AUTO). During AUTO, ROBOTS operate without any DRIVE
TEAM control or input. ROBOTS score SCORING ELEMENTS, may leave their
ROBOT STARTING LINE and retrieve additional SCORING ELEMENTS, and may
climb their TOWER. There is a 3-second delay between AUTO and TELEOP for
scoring purposes as described in section [6.5 Scoring]{.underline}.

The second period of each MATCH is the remaining 2 minutes and 20
seconds (2:20) and called the Teleoperated Period (TELEOP). During
TELEOP, DRIVERS remotely operate ROBOTS to retrieve and score SCORING
ELEMENTS and climb their TOWER. TELEOP is split into further segments:
the TRANSITION SHIFT, the ALLIANCE SHIFTS, and END GAME. There are four
ALLIANCE SHIFTS named SHIFT 1, SHIFT 2, SHIFT 3, and SHIFT 4. The
duration of each timeframe is shown in [Table 6‑2]{.underline}.

+------------------+------------------+--------------+----------------+
| MATCH Period     | MATCH Timeframe  | Duration     | Timer Values   |
+==================+==================+==============+================+
| AUTO             | AUTO             | 20 Seconds   | 0:20 -- 0:00   |

|                  | SHIFT 3          | 25 Seconds   | 1:20 -- 0:55   |
|                  +------------------+--------------+----------------+
|                  | SHIFT 4          | 25 Seconds   | 0:55 -- 0:30   |
|                  +------------------+--------------+----------------+
|                  | END GAME         | 30 Seconds   | 0:30 -- 0:00   |
+------------------+------------------+--------------+----------------+

: : MATCH SHIFTS

### HUB Status

During the MATCH, the status of a HUB can be either active or inactive.
FUEL scored in an active HUB is worth MATCH points but FUEL scored in an
inactive HUB will not earn any points as shown in [Table
6‑3]{.underline}. Both ALLIANCE HUBS are active during AUTO, the
TRANSITION SHIFT, and END GAME. During the ALLIANCE SHIFTS, only one
ALLIANCE HUB will be active while the other ALLIANCE'S HUB becomes
inactive.

The status of both HUBS during the ALLIANCE SHIFTS is based on the
results of AUTO. The ALLIANCE that scores the most FUEL during AUTO will
have their HUB set to inactive for SHIFT 1 while their opponent's HUB
will be active, as shown in [Table 6‑3]{.underline}. HUB statuses will
then alternate at the start of each following ALLIANCE SHIFT, until the
start of END GAME where both HUBS return to active. If both ALLIANCES
score the same number of FUEL during AUTO, the FMS will randomly select
an ALLIANCE and use its HUB status order for the ALLIANCE SHIFTS during
the MATCH.

FMS relays the ALLIANCE who scored more FUEL during AUTO, or the
ALLIANCE selected by FMS, to all OPERATOR CONSOLES simultaneously at the
start of TELEOP.\
Specific details on the format of the data can be found on the [[2026
FRC Control System
website]{.underline}](https://frc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/yearly-overview/2026-Game-Data.html).

: : Hub Status during MATCH Timeframes

## Scoring 

ALLIANCES are rewarded for accomplishing various actions throughout a
MATCH, including scoring FUEL, climbing their TOWER, and winning or
tying MATCHES.

Rewards are granted either via MATCH points or Ranking Points (often
abbreviated to RP, which increase the measure used to rank teams in the
Qualification Tournament).

All scores are assessed and updated throughout the MATCH, except as
follows:

A.  assessment of FUEL scored in the HUB continues for up to 3 seconds
    after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following AUTO.

<!-- -->

K.  assessment of FUEL scored in the HUB continues for up to 3 seconds
    after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP.

L.  assessment of AUTO TOWER points is made after the ARENA timer
    displays 0:00 following AUTO.

M.  assessment of TELEOP TOWER points is made 3 seconds after the ARENA
    timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP, or when all ROBOTS have come
    to rest following the conclusion of the MATCH, whichever happens
    first.

Assessment of FUEL scored in the HUB continues for 3 seconds after the
HUB deactivates to account for FUEL processing time.

TOWER points are evaluated and scored by human volunteers. Teams are
encouraged to make sure that it is obvious and unambiguous that the
criteria are met.

### SCORING ELEMENT Scoring Criteria

A FUEL is scored in the HUB once it passes through the top opening of
the HUB and through the sensor array.

### ROBOT Scoring Criteria

To qualify for TOWER points for a given LEVEL, a ROBOT must meet the
following conditions:

- For LEVEL 1 -- a ROBOT must no longer touching the CARPET or the TOWER
  BASE, or

- For LEVEL 2 -- a ROBOT must be positioned such that its BUMPERS are
  completely above the LOW RUNG, or

- For LEVEL 3 -- a ROBOT must be positioned such that its BUMPERS are
  completely above the MID RUNG.

Additionally, a ROBOT **must be** contacting the RUNGS or UPRIGHTS and
may additionally only contact the following elements:

A.  the TOWER WALL,

<!-- -->

N.  support structure,

O.  FUEL, and/or.

P.  another ROBOT.

A ROBOT may only earn TOWER points for LEVEL 1 during AUTO. A ROBOT may
only earn TOWER points for a single LEVEL during TELEOP.

## Violations

Unless otherwise noted, all violations are assigned for each instance of
a rule violation. A description of the penalties is listed in [Table
6‑6]{.underline}. All rules throughout the Game Rules section are called
as perceived by a REFEREE.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Penalty        Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  MINOR FOUL     a credit of 5 points towards the opponent's MATCH point
                 total

  MAJOR FOUL     a credit of 15 points towards the opponent's MATCH point
                 total

  YELLOW CARD    issued by the Head REFEREE for egregious ROBOT or team
                 member behavior or rule violations. A subsequent YELLOW
                 CARD within the same tournament phase results in a RED
                 CARD.

  RED CARD       issued by the Head REFEREE for egregious ROBOT or team
                 member behavior or rule violations which results in a
                 team being DISQUALIFIED for the MATCH.

  DISABLED       the state in which a ROBOT is commanded to deactivate
                 all outputs, rendering the ROBOT inoperable for the
                 remainder of the MATCH.

  DISQUALIFIED   the state of a team in which they receive 0 MATCH points
                 and 0 Ranking Points in a Qualification MATCH or causes
                 their ALLIANCE to receive 0 MATCH points in a Playoff
                 MATCH

  VERBAL WARNING a warning issued by event staff or the Head REFEREE.

  ALLIANCE is    An ALLIANCE is ineligible for the specified RP for that
  ineligible for MATCH. This overrides any RP awarded through normal
  RP             MATCH play or other rule violations.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Rule violations

### YELLOW and RED CARDS

In addition to rule violations explicitly listed throughout this
document, YELLOW CARDS and RED CARDS are used in *FIRST* Robotics
Competition to address team and ROBOT behavior that does not align with
the mission, values, and culture of *FIRST*.

The Head REFEREE may assign a YELLOW CARD as a warning, or a RED CARD
for egregious behavior inappropriate at a *FIRST* Robotics Competition
event.

If an action resulting in the assignment of a YELLOW or RED CARD is
determined to be the result of an ARENA FAULT, per section 10.2, the
CARD will be rescinded.

A YELLOW or RED CARD is indicated on the audience display MATCH results
screen. During Qualification MATCHES, A YELLOW or RED CARD is indicated
next to the team who received the CARD and the Game Announcer describes
the violation. During Playoff MATCHES, the card is applied to the whole
ALLIANCE and as such "RED CARD\" or \"YELLOW CARD\" appears above the
ALLIANCE number.

YELLOW CARDS are additive, meaning that a second YELLOW CARD is
automatically converted to a RED CARD. A team is issued a RED CARD for
any subsequent incident in which they receive an additional YELLOW CARD,
including earning a second YELLOW CARD during a single MATCH. A second
YELLOW CARD is indicated by the Head REFEREE holding a YELLOW CARD and
RED CARD in the air simultaneously after the completion of the MATCH. A
team that has received either a YELLOW CARD or a RED CARD carries a
YELLOW CARD into subsequent MATCHES, except as noted below.

Once a team receives a YELLOW or RED CARD, a yellow rectangle will show
next to the team number on the audience display during subsequent
MATCHES, including any replays.

<figure>

style="width:6.53125in;height:0.61181in"
alt="Example audience display graphic showing YELLOW CARD indicators. " />
<figcaption><p>Example audience screen graphic showing YELLOW CARD
indicators</p></figcaption>
</figure>

All YELLOW CARDS are cleared in FMS at the conclusion of Practice,
Qualification, and division Playoff MATCHES. VERBAL WARNINGS issued by
the head REFEREE are cleared after Practice MATCHES and persist from
Qualification MATCHES through subsequent tournament phases.

### YELLOW and RED CARD application

YELLOW and RED CARDS are applied based on the following:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Time YELLOW or RED CARDS     MATCH to which CARD is applied:
  earned:                      
  ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------
  Prior to Qualification       REFEREES may or may not be present during
  MATCHES                      Practice MATCHES. With input from event
                               staff, the Head REFEREE may opt to
                               perpetuate a VERBAL WARNING or YELLOW CARD
                               earned prior to Qualification MATCHES to
                               the first Qualification MATCH for
                               particularly egregious behavior.

  during the Qualification     team's current (or just-completed) MATCH.
  MATCHES                      In the case where the team participated as
                               a SURROGATE in the current (or just
                               completed) MATCH, the card is applied to
                               the team's previous MATCH (i.e. the team's
                               second Qualification MATCH)

  between the end of           ALLIANCE'S first Playoff MATCH
  Qualification MATCHES and    
  the start of Playoff MATCHES 

  during the Playoff MATCHES   ALLIANCE'S current (or just-completed)
                               MATCH
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : : YELLOW and RED CARD application

A MATCH is no longer the current MATCH once the results of the MATCH
have been posted or the Head REFEREE or their designee has indicated
that teams can collect their ROBOTS, whichever is later.

Please see examples of the application of YELLOW and RED CARDS as shown
in section [6.6.4 Violation Details]{.underline}.

### YELLOW and RED CARDS during Playoff MATCHES

During Playoff MATCHES, YELLOW and RED CARDS are assigned to the
violating team's entire ALLIANCE instead of to only the violating team.
If an ALLIANCE receives 2 YELLOW CARDS, the entire ALLIANCE is issued a
RED CARD which results in DISQUALIFICATION for the associated MATCH. If
both ALLIANCES receive a RED CARD, the ALLIANCE assessed the first RED
CARD, chronologically, is DISQUALIFIED and loses the MATCH.

### Violation Details

There are several styles of violation wording used in this manual. Below
are some example violations and a clarification of the way the violation
would be assessed. The examples shown do not represent all possible
violations, but rather a representative set of combinations.

+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Example Violation           | Expanded Interpretation                |
+=============================+========================================+
| MINOR FOUL                  | Upon violation, a MINOR FOUL is        |
|                             | assessed against the violating         |
|                             | ALLIANCE.                              |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD  | Upon violation, a MAJOR FOUL is        |
|                             | assessed against the violating         |
|                             | ALLIANCE. After the MATCH, the Head    |
|                             | REFEREE presents the violating team    |
|                             | with a YELLOW CARD.                    |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| MINOR FOUL per additional   | Upon violation, a number of MINOR      |
| SCORING ELEMENT. If         | FOULS are assessed against the         |
| egregious, YELLOW CARD      | violating ALLIANCE equal to the number |
|                             | of additional SCORING ELEMENTS beyond  |
|                             | the permitted quantity. Additionally,  |
|                             | if the REFEREES determine that the     |
|                             | action was egregious, the Head REFEREE |
|                             | presents the violating team with a     |
|                             | YELLOW CARD after the MATCH.           |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| MINOR FOUL. MAJOR FOUL IF   | Upon initial violation in a MATCH, a   |
| REPEATED                    | MINOR FOUL is assessed against the     |
|                             | violating ALLIANCE. If the ALLIANCE    |
|                             | ROBOT repeats the infraction in the    |
|                             | MATCH, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed        |
|                             | against the violating ALLIANCE.        |
|                             | Assuming no additional infractions of  |
|                             | that rule by that ROBOT in that MATCH, |
|                             | the ROBOT has "earned" a MINOR FOUL    |
|                             | and a MAJOR FOUL for their ALLIANCE.   |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| MAJOR FOUL, and for every 3 | Upon violation, a MAJOR FOUL is        |
| seconds in which the        | assessed against the violating         |
| situation is not corrected, | ALLIANCE and the REFEREE begins to     |
| a MAJOR FOUL is assessed    | count. Their count continues until the |
|                             | criteria to discontinue the count are  |
|                             | met, and for each 3 seconds within     |
|                             | that time, an additional MAJOR FOUL is |
|                             | assessed against the violating         |
|                             | ALLIANCE. A ROBOT in violation of this |
|                             | type of rule for 15 seconds receives a |
|                             | total of 6 MAJOR FOULS (assuming no    |
|                             | other rules were being simultaneously  |
|                             | violated).                             |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| RED CARD for the ALLIANCE   | After the MATCH, the Head REFEREE      |
|                             | presents the violating ALLIANCE with a |
|                             | RED CARD in the following fashion:     |
|                             |                                        |
|                             | - In a PLAYOFF MATCH, a single RED     |
|                             |   CARD is assessed to the ALLIANCE.    |
|                             |                                        |
|                             | - In all other scenarios, each team on |
|                             |   the ALLIANCE is issued a RED CARD.   |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+

: Violation examples

## Head REFEREE and FTA Interaction

The Head REFEREE has the ultimate authority in the ARENA during the
event, but may receive input from additional sources, e.g. Game
Designers, *FIRST* personnel, FTA, and other event staff. The Head
REFEREE rulings are final. No event staff, including the Head REFEREE,
will review video, photos, artistic renderings, etc. of any MATCH, from
any source, under any circumstances.

### Question Box (Q)

Each ALLIANCE has a designated Question Box near the scoring table. If a
DRIVE TEAM has a question about a MATCH, the FIELD, etc., they may send
up to 2 DRIVE TEAM members to their corresponding Question Box.
Depending on timing, the Head REFEREE or FTA may postpone any requested
discussion until the end of the subsequent MATCH.

Technical questions regarding FIELD or ROBOT operation are addressed by
the FTA, and additional team members are invited to participate in these
conversations if necessary. If a DRIVE TEAM needs clarification on a
ruling or score, per [Q101]{.underline}, up to 2 DRIVE TEAM members
should address the Head REFEREE after the ARENA Reset Signal (e.g. FIELD
lights turn green).

While FMS tracks quantities of MINOR and MAJOR FOULS, *FIRST* instructs
REFEREES to not self-track details about MINOR FOULS and MAJOR FOULS; as
a result, REFEREES are not expected to recall details about what MINOR
FOULS and MAJOR FOULS were made, when they occurred, and against whom.

Any reasonable question is fair game in the Question Box, and Head
REFEREES will make good faith efforts to provide helpful feedback (e.g.
how/why certain MINOR FOULS are being called, why a particular ROBOT may
be susceptible to certain MINOR FOULS based on its design or game play,
how specific rules are being called or interpreted), but please know
that they may not be able to supply specific details.

101. **\*Head REFEREE Interactions.** A team may only address the Head
     REFEREE with maximum of 2 people, 1 of which must be a STUDENT.

Violation: The Head REFEREE will not address non-compliant team members
or peripheral conversations.

Some events may restrict ARENA access to members of the DRIVE TEAM. Team
members are permitted to swap buttons within their team as needed to
access the Question Box.

As much as possible, the STUDENT should be an active participant in the
conversation.

Teams should not record interactions without consent (see
[E117]{.underline}).

102. **Conversations must be civil.** Any team interaction with the Head
     REFEREE must be appropriate.

Violation: The Head REFEREE may terminate the conversation to allow time
for parties to cool down. A person with subsequent violations will not
be allowed to interact with the Head REFEREE.

Examples of inappropriate behavior are outlined in [G201]{.underline}.

## Other Logistics

SCORING ELEMENTS that leave the FIELD (other than through the OUTPOST)
are placed back into the FIELD approximately at the point of exit by
FIELD STAFF (REFEREES, FTAs, or other staff working around the FIELD) at
the earliest safe opportunity.

Note that ROBOTS and HUMAN PLAYERS may not deliberately cause SCORING
ELEMENTS to leave the FIELD (see [G405]{.underline}).

An ARENA FAULT (an error in ARENA operation described in section [10.2
MATCH Replays]{.underline}) is not called for MATCHES that accidentally
begin with damaged SCORING ELEMENTS. Damaged SCORING ELEMENTS are not
replaced until the next ARENA reset period. DRIVE TEAMS should alert the
FIELD STAFF to any missing or damaged SCORING ELEMENTS prior to the
start of the MATCH but as noted in [6.3.4]{.underline}, the exact number
of FUEL in the NEUTRAL ZONE may vary.

Once the MATCH is over and the Head REFEREE determines that the FIELD is
safe for FIELD STAFF and DRIVE TEAMS, they or their designee change the
FIELD lights to green and DRIVE TEAMS may retrieve their ROBOT. Some
MATCHES may include a short period afterward to allow FIELD staff to
begin to clean the field to make it easier and safer for teams to
collect their robot. This period is indicated with purple lights on the
team signs and the word "clean" displayed. TEAMS are not allowed on the
field during this time.

During ARENA reset, the ARENA is cleared of ROBOTS and OPERATOR CONSOLES
from the MATCH that just ended, ROBOTS and OPERATOR CONSOLES for the
subsequent MATCH are loaded into the ARENA by DRIVE TEAMS, and FIELD
STAFF reset ARENA elements.

*FIRST* Robotics Competition uses 3 words in the context of how
durations and actions are assessed with regards to evaluation of rules
and assignment of violations. These words provide general guidance to
describe benchmarks to be used across the program. It is not the intent
for REFEREES to provide a count during the time periods.

- MOMENTARY describes durations that are fewer than approximately 3
  seconds.

- CONTINUOUS describes durations that are more than approximately 10
  seconds.

- REPEATED describes actions that happen more than once within a MATCH.

# Game Rules (G)

## Personal Safety

101. **\*Humans, remain outside the FIELD.** A team member may not reach
     into the FIELD with any part of their body during a MATCH .

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during
the event.

Violations of this rule apply to the entire team, not specifically to
any 1 individual. For example, a member of Team 9999 reaches onto the
FIELD during MATCH 3, and a different member reaches onto the FIELD
during MATCH 25. The team receives a VERBAL WARNING for the first
violation and a YELLOW CARD for the second.

102. **\*Never step over the guardrail.** A team member may only enter
     or exit the FIELD through open gates and only enter if FIELD
     lighting (FIELD facing side of the team signs and timers) is green,
     unless explicitly instructed by a REFEREE or an FTA.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during
the event.

Teams are encouraged to ensure that all members of their DRIVE TEAM are
aware of this rule. It's easy to violate, particularly when teams are
doing their best to move on and off the FIELD quickly. The violations of
this rule are intended to avoid nuisance penalties, but still enforce
safety requirements around the FIELD. There is the potential for injury
when stepping over the guardrail.

Violations of this rule apply to the entire team, not specifically to
any 1 individual. For example, a member of Team 9999 steps over the
guardrail prior to MATCH 3, and a different member steps over the
guardrail prior to MATCH 25. The team receives a VERBAL WARNING for the
first violation and a YELLOW CARD for the second.

103. **\*Be careful what you interact with.** A team member is
     prohibited from the following actions with regards to interaction
     with ARENA elements.

<!-- -->

A.  climbing on or inside,

<!-- -->

A.  hanging from,

B.  manipulating such that it doesn't return to its original shape
    without human intervention, and

C.  damaging.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during
the event.

The REBUILT FIELD has obstacles, and caution should be applied when
navigating the FIELD. Teams should avoid carrying their ROBOT over the
BUMP.

Walking over the BUMP is not considered climbing on.

104. **\*Teams may not enable their ROBOTS on the FIELD.** Teams may not
     tether to the ROBOT while on the FIELD except in special
     circumstances (e.g. after Opening Ceremonies, before an immediate
     MATCH replay, etc.) and with the express permission from the FTA or
     a REFEREE.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during
the event.

Teams are encouraged to consider this rule when developing their ROBOTS.

FMS will not enable ROBOTS after the conclusion of the MATCH.

For the purposes of this rule, tethering includes any wired or wireless
connection used to electrically energize and/or control elements on the
ROBOT. The safety of teams and volunteers in close proximity to ROBOTS
and ARENA elements on the FIELD is of the utmost importance, therefore
ROBOTS or ROBOT COMPONENTS may not be enabled in any way on the FIELD
before or after the MATCH.

ROBOTS need to be safely transported off the FIELD and back to the pits
after the MATCH, and there may be bystanders, doorways, or height
restrictions along the route.

## Conduct

201. **\*Be a good person.** All teams must be civil toward everyone and
     respectful of team and event equipment while at a *FIRST* Robotics
     Competition event.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during
the event.

Examples of inappropriate behavior include, but are not limited to, the
use of offensive language or other uncivil conduct.

Examples of particularly contemptible behavior that is likely to result
in ARENA ejection include, but are not limited to, the following:

A.  assault, e.g. throwing something that hits another person (even if
    unintended),

<!-- -->

A.  threat, e.g. saying something like "if you don't reverse that call,
    I'll make you regret it,"

B.  harassment, e.g. badgering someone with no new information after a
    decision's been made or a question's been answered,

C.  bullying, e.g. using body or verbal language to cause another person
    to feel inadequate,

D.  insulting, e.g. telling someone they don't deserve to be on a DRIVE
    TEAM,

E.  swearing at another person (versus swearing under one's breath or at
    oneself), and

F.  yelling at another person(s) in anger or frustration.

<!-- -->

105. **\*Don't bang on the glass.** A team member may never strike or
     hit the DRIVER STATION plastic windows.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during
the event.

106. **\*Asking other teams to throw a MATCH -- not cool.** A team may
     not encourage an ALLIANCE of which it is not a member to play
     beneath its ability.

Note: This rule is not intended to prevent an ALLIANCE from planning
and/or executing its own strategy in a specific MATCH in which all the
teams are members of the ALLIANCE.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. RED CARD if subsequent violations during the
event.

Example 1: A MATCH is being played by Teams A, B, and C, in which Team C
is encouraged by Team D to not get on the TOWER at the end of the MATCH,
resulting in Teams A, B, and C not earning a Ranking Point. Team D's
motivation for this behavior is to prevent Team A from rising in the
Tournament rankings and negatively affecting Team D's ranking. Team D
has violated this rule.

Example 2: A MATCH is being played by Teams A, B, and C, in which Team A
is assigned to participate as a SURROGATE. Team D encourages Team A to
not participate in the MATCH so that Team D gains ranking position over
Teams B and C. Team D has violated this rule.

Example 3: Asking a team to "no show" for a MATCH.

*FIRST* considers the action of a team influencing another team to throw
a MATCH, to deliberately miss Ranking Points, etc. incompatible with
*FIRST* values and not a strategy any team should employ.

107. **\*Letting someone coerce you into throwing a MATCH -- also not
     cool.** A team, as the result of encouragement by a team not on
     their ALLIANCE, may not play beneath its ability.

Note: This rule is not intended to prevent an ALLIANCE from planning
and/or executing its own strategy in a specific MATCH in which all the
ALLIANCE members are participants.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. RED CARD if subsequent violations during the
event.

Example 1: A MATCH is being played by Teams A, B, and C. Team D requests
Team C ignore the TOWER at the end of the MATCH, resulting in Teams A,
B, and C not being able to earn the TRAVERSAL RP. Team C accepts this
request from Team D. Team D's motivation for this behavior is to prevent
Team A from rising in the Tournament rankings negatively affecting Team
D's ranking. Team C has violated this rule.

Example 2: A MATCH is being played by Teams A, B, and C, in which Team A
is assigned to participate as a SURROGATE. Team A accepts Team D's
request not to participate in the MATCH so that Team D gains ranking
position over Teams B and C. Team A has violated this rule.

*FIRST* considers the action of a team influencing another team to throw
a MATCH, to deliberately miss Ranking Points, etc. incompatible with
*FIRST* values and not a strategy any team should employ.

108. **\*Throwing your own MATCH is bad.** A team may not intentionally
     lose a MATCH or sacrifice Ranking Points in an effort to lower
     their own ranking or manipulate the rankings of other teams.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. RED CARD if subsequent violations during the
event.

The intent of this rule is not to punish teams who are employing
alternate strategies, but rather to ensure that it is clear that
throwing MATCHES to negatively affect your own rankings, or to
manipulate the rankings of other teams (i.e. throw a MATCH to lower a
partner\'s ranking, and/or increase the ranking of another team not in
the MATCH) is incompatible with *FIRST* values and not a strategy any
team should employ.

109. **\*Don\'t violate rules for RPs.** A team or ALLIANCE may not
     collude with another team to each purposefully violate a rule in an
     attempt to influence Ranking Points.

Violation: YELLOW CARD and the ALLIANCE is ineligible for the BONUS RPs.

For example, if Team A on the blue ALLIANCE agrees with Team F on the
red ALLIANCE to contact each other while each ROBOT is climbing the
TOWER resulting in both ALLIANCES being awarded the TRAVERSAL RP.

110. **\*Don't abuse ARENA access.** A team member (except DRIVERS,
     HUMAN PLAYERS, and DRIVE COACHES) granted access to restricted
     areas in and around the ARENA (e.g. via TECHNICIAN button, event
     issued Media badges, etc.) may not assist or use signaling devices
     during the MATCH. Exceptions will be granted for inconsequential
     infractions and in cases concerning safety.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during
the event.

The TECHNICIAN'S role is to help the team prepare the ROBOT so it can
perform at its full potential during a MATCH. The TECHNICIAN, except as
described at the end of section [6.2 DRIVE TEAM]{.underline}, is not an
additional DRIVE COACH, DRIVER, or HUMAN PLAYER.

Team members in open-access spectator seating areas are not considered
to be in a restricted area and are not prevented from assisting or using
signaling devices. See [E102]{.underline} for related details.

111. **\*Show up to your Qualification MATCHES.** If a ROBOT has passed
     initial, complete inspection, at least 1 member of its DRIVE TEAM
     must report to the ARENA and participate in each of their assigned
     Qualification MATCHES.

Violation: DISQUALIFIED from the current MATCH.

height="4.122641076115485in"}

The team should inform the Lead Queuer if the team's ROBOT is not able
to participate.

112. **\*Keep your ROBOT together.** A ROBOT may not intentionally
     detach or leave a part on the FIELD.

Violation: RED CARD.

113. **\*Don't expect to gain by doing others harm.** A strategy not
     consistent with standard gameplay and clearly aimed at forcing the
     opponent ALLIANCE to violate a rule is not in the spirit of *FIRST*
     Robotics Competition and not allowed. Rule violations forced in
     this manner will not result in an assignment of a penalty to the
     targeted ALLIANCE.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL. YELLOW CARD if REPEATED.

This rule does not apply for strategies consistent with standard
gameplay, for example:

A.  a red ALLIANCE ROBOT attempting to climb their TOWER in the final 30
    seconds of the MATCH contacts a blue ALLIANCE ROBOT.

B.  a blue ALLIANCE ROBOT is attempting to play defense on a red
    ALLIANCE ROBOT attempting to score into the HUB from within their
    ALLIANCE ZONE and pushes them outside their ALLIANCE ZONE.

This rule requires an intentional act with limited or no opportunity for
the team being acted on to avoid the penalty such as:

G.  forcing an opponent ROBOT to catch FUEL by pushing them far from
    (i.e. more than 48.0in (1.22m)) the HUB exit to under the HUB exit
    to make them violate [G408]{.underline}.

H.  a blue ALLIANCE ROBOT, pushing a red ALLIANCE ROBOT far from (i.e.
    more than 48.0in (1.22m)) the TOWER into another red ALLIANCE ROBOT
    which is in contact with the TOWER and the REFEREE perceiving that
    the blue ROBOT is deliberately making the red ROBOT violate
    [G420]{.underline}.

<!-- -->

114. **\*Egregious or exceptional violations.** Egregious behavior
     beyond what is listed in the rules or subsequent violations of any
     rule or procedure during the event is prohibited.

In addition to rule violations explicitly listed in this manual and
witnessed by a REFEREE, the Head REFEREE may assign a YELLOW or RED CARD
for egregious ROBOT actions or team member behavior at any time during
the event.

Please see section [6.6.1 YELLOW and RED CARDS]{.underline} for
additional detail.

Violation: YELLOW or RED CARD.

The intent of this rule is to provide the Head REFEREES the flexibility
necessary to keep the event running smoothly, as well as keep the safety
of all the participants as the highest priority. Behaviors that put the
*FIRST* community or integrity of the game at risk are not allowed and
are violations of this rule. Those behaviors include, but are not
limited to the list below:

A.  inappropriate behavior as outlined in the blue box of
    [G201]{.underline},

<!-- -->

I.  jumping over the guardrail,

J.  pushing past the FIELD reset person blocking an open gate to get on
    the FIELD,

K.  reaching into the FIELD and grabbing a ROBOT during a MATCH,

L.  a single PIN in excess of 15 seconds,

M.  exploiting the 3-second window after a MATCH described in [section
    [6.5 Scoring]{.underline}](#scoring) to avoid rule violations (e.g.
    triggering an over-extension that enables TOWER points or using a
    ROBOT'S residual energy to impact an opponent ROBOT on their TOWER),

N.  triggering scoring sensors or otherwise interfering with FMS or
    FIELD operation,

O.  intentionally crossing the CENTER LINE in AUTO in order to interfere
    with an opponent ROBOT'S AUTO,

P.  intentionally ejecting a large quantity of FUEL out of the FIELD,

Q.  intentionally exceeding the expansion limits for strategic benefit
    (i.e. climb the TOWER, block part of the FIELD, etc.),

R.  a HUMAN PLAYER hoarding a large quantity of FUEL outside the
    designated locations in [G427]{.underline},

S.  Intentionally scoring a large quantity of FUEL into the HUB from the
    NEUTRAL ZONE.

The Head REFEREE may assign a YELLOW or RED CARD for a single instance
of a rule violation such as the examples given in items above, or for
multiple instances of any single rule violation. Teams should be aware
that any rule in this manual could escalate to a YELLOW or RED CARD. The
Head REFEREE has final authority on all rules and violations at an
event.

115. **\*All teams can play.** A team may not encourage another team to
     exclude their ROBOT or be BYPASSED from a qualification MATCH for
     any reason.

Violation: YELLOW CARD. RED CARD if the ROBOT does not participate in
the MATCH.

## Pre-MATCH

301. **\*Be prompt.** A DRIVE TEAM member may not cause significant
     delays to the start of their MATCH. Causing a significant delay
     requires both of the following to be true:

<!-- -->

A.  The expected MATCH start time has passed, and

Event volunteers communicate schedule delays with teams to the best of
their ability. The Pit Display (which is typically located near the Pit
Administration desk) shows any event timing delay. Announcements on the
FIELD and in the pits also provide information on delays, and any team
uncertain of when to queue for a MATCH should communicate with queuing
volunteers.

During Qualification MATCHES, the expected start time of the MATCH is
the time indicated on the MATCH schedule or the cycle time for current
round minus 3 minutes from the end of the previous MATCH (which is
reflected on the schedule on the Pit Display), whichever is later.

During Playoff MATCHES, the expected start time of the MATCH is the time
indicated on the MATCH schedule or 15 minutes from either ALLIANCE'S
previous MATCH, whichever is later.

A.  The DRIVE TEAM has access to the FIELD and is neither MATCH ready
    nor making a good faith effort, to quickly become MATCH ready.

Teams that have violated [G208]{.underline} or have 1 DRIVE TEAM member
present and have informed event staff that their ROBOT will not be
participating in the MATCH are considered MATCH ready and not in
violation of this rule.

Violation: If a Qualification MATCH, VERBAL WARNING. MAJOR FOUL for the
upcoming MATCH if a subsequent violation occurs within the tournament
phase. If the DRIVE TEAM is not MATCH ready within 2 minutes of the
VERBAL WARNING/MAJOR FOUL and the Head REFEREE perceives no good faith
effort by the DRIVE TEAM to quickly become MATCH ready, DISABLED.

If a Playoff MATCH, VERBAL WARNING issued to the ALLIANCE. MAJOR FOUL
for the ALLIANCE'S upcoming MATCH if a subsequent violation occurs
within the tournament phase. If the ALLIANCE is not MATCH ready within 2
minutes of the VERBAL WARNING/MAJOR FOUL having been issued to all 3
teams and the Head REFEREE perceives no good faith effort by the DRIVE
TEAM(s) to quickly become MATCH ready, the offending team's ROBOT is
DISABLED.

The intent of this rule is to provide an equitable amount of time for
both ALLIANCES to prepare for each MATCH and give DRIVE TEAMS grace
given extenuating circumstances that cause them to be late.

Once a VERBAL WARNING /MAJOR FOUL is issued, the Head REFEREE starts a
2-minute timer and makes a good faith effort to share the timer's status
with the delaying DRIVE TEAM.

Being "MATCH ready" requires that the ROBOT is on the FIELD, in its
STARTING CONFIGURATION, and turned on. Additionally, the DRIVE TEAM
members must be in their starting positions.

In general, good faith efforts to quickly become MATCH ready are
entirely for the purposes of transitioning the ROBOT into a MATCH ready
state (i.e. not attempts to significantly alter a ROBOT's capabilities.)
Examples of good faith efforts to quickly become MATCH ready include but
are not limited to:

A.  walking safely towards the FIELD with a ROBOT that a team is not
    actively modifying,

<!-- -->

T.  applying quick fixes such as tape or cable ties to make the ROBOT
    compliant with STARTING CONFIGURATION requirements,

U.  waiting for an OPERATOR CONSOLE computer to boot, and

V.  working with FIELD STAFF to get the ROBOT connected to the FIELD.

Examples that are not considered good faith efforts to quickly become
MATCH ready include but are not limited to:

W.  a ROBOT not moving to the FIELD,

X.  a ROBOT moving to the FIELD but being actively modified while doing
    so,

Y.  a DRIVE TEAM member remaining on the FIELD once a MATCH is ready to
    begin (indicated by the green LEDs having turned off),

Z.  installing BUMPERS, charging pneumatic systems, or any other ROBOT
    maintenance not considered a quick fix as described in item B above
    once on the FIELD,

A.  time-consuming use of alignment devices that are external to the
    ROBOT (e.g. a DRIVE TEAM could bring and use a measuring tape, as
    long as there is no delay to the MATCH by doing so), and

B.  repairs more substantial than those described in B.

There are no rules that prohibit use of hand tools (including battery
operated tools) while setting up ROBOTS from the FIELD, provided they do
not cause significant delay or cause safety concerns.

116. **\*Limit what you use during a MATCH**. Items used during a match
     must fit on your team's DRIVER STATION shelf, be worn or held by
     members from your DRIVE TEAM, or be an item used as an
     accommodation (e.g. stools, crutches, etc.). Regardless of if the
     equipment fits the criteria above, it may not:

<!-- -->

A.  be employed in a way that introduces a safety hazard,

<!-- -->

B.  extend more than 78.0in (1.981m) above the floor,

C.  communicate with anything or anyone outside of the ARENA with the
    exception of medically required equipment,

D.  block visibility for FIELD STAFF or audience members, or

E.  jam or interfere with the remote sensing capabilities of another
    team or the FIELD.

> Violation: MATCH will not start until the situation is remedied. If
> discovered or used inappropriately during a MATCH, YELLOW CARD.

Examples of equipment that may be considered a safety hazard in the
confined space of the ALLIANCE AREA include, but are not limited to, a
folding step stool, ladder, or a large signaling device.

Using an item that has wireless communications disabled complies with C
above.

Examples of jamming or interfering with remote sensing capabilities
include, but are not limited to, mimicking the FIELD AprilTags and
shining bright lighting or laser pointers onto the FIELD.

117. **\*Start your ROBOTS.** A ROBOT must meet all following
     MATCH-start requirements:

<!-- -->

A.  it does not pose a hazard to humans, FIELD elements, or other
    ROBOTS,

<!-- -->

F.  has passed initial, complete inspection, i.e. it's compliant with
    all ROBOT rules (for exceptions regarding Practice MATCHES, see
    section [9 Inspection & Eligibility (I)]{.underline},

G.  if modified after initial Inspection, it's compliant with I104,

H.  its BUMPERS overlap their ROBOT STARTING LINE,

I.  it's not contacting the BUMP,

J.  it's the only team-provided item left on the FIELD,

K.  it's not attached to, entangled with, or suspended from any FIELD
    element,

L.  it's confined to its STARTING CONFIGURATION (reference R102 and
    R104), and

M.  it fully and solely supports not more than 8 FUEL (as described in
    section 6.3.4 SCORING ELEMENTS).

Violation: If fix is a quick remedy, the MATCH won't start until all
requirements are met. If it is not a quick remedy, DISABLED and, at the
discretion of the Head REFEREE, must be re-inspected. If a ROBOT not
compliant with part B or C participates, its team receives a RED CARD.

If a ROBOT is BYPASSED prior to the start of the MATCH, the DRIVE TEAM
may not remove the ROBOT from the FIELD without permission from the Head
REFEREE or the FTA.

For assessment of many of the items listed above, the Head REFEREE is
likely to consult with the LRI.

## In-MATCH

Rules in this section pertain to game play once a MATCH begins.

### AUTO

The AUTO period is the first 20 seconds of the MATCH, and the FMS blocks
any DRIVER control, so ROBOTS operate with only their pre-programmed
instructions. Rules in this section apply only during the AUTO period.

401. **\*Behind the lines.** In AUTO, each DRIVE TEAM member must remain
     in their staged areas. A DRIVE TEAM member staged behind a HUMAN
     STARTING LINE may not contact anything in front of that HUMAN
     STARTING LINE, unless for personal or equipment safety, to press
     the E-Stop or A-Stop, or granted permission by a Head REFEREE or
     FTA.

Violation: MINOR FOUL regardless of the number of items contacted.

Pointing, gesturing, or otherwise extending across the HUMAN STARTING
LINE such that contact is not made with carpet or other ARENA elements
is not a violation of this rule.

An example of an exception for equipment safety is if an OPERATOR
CONSOLE starts to fall from, or has already fallen off of, the DRIVER
STATION shelf. In that circumstance, DRIVE TEAM members may step forward
to catch it or pick it up off the ground and return it to the shelf.

118. **\*Let the ROBOT do its thing.** In AUTO, a DRIVE TEAM member may
     not directly or indirectly interact with a ROBOT or an OPERATOR
     CONSOLE unless for personal safety, OPERATOR CONSOLE safety, or
     pressing an E-Stop or A-Stop. A HUMAN PLAYER entering FUEL onto the
     FIELD is an exception to this rule.

Violation: MINOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD.

119. **Limited AUTO opponent interaction.** In AUTO, a ROBOT whose
     BUMPERS are completely across the CENTER LINE (i.e. to the opposite
     side of the CENTER LINE from its ROBOT STARTING LINE) may not
     contact an opponent ROBOT.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL.

### SCORING ELEMENTS

120. **\*ROBOTS: use SCORING ELEMENTS as directed.** A ROBOT may not
     deliberately use a SCORING ELEMENT in an attempt to ease or amplify
     a challenge associated with a FIELD element.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL.

Examples include, but are not limited to:

A.  launching SCORING ELEMENTS at opponent ROBOTS,

<!-- -->

C.  using SCORING ELEMENTS to elevate ROBOTS in an attempt to climb the
    TOWER,

D.  positioning SCORING ELEMENTS to impede opponent access to their
    TOWER,

<!-- -->

121. **\*Keep SCORING ELEMENTS in bounds.** A ROBOT may not
     intentionally eject SCORING ELEMENTS from the FIELD (either
     directly or by bouncing off a FIELD element or other ROBOT) with an
     exception of the OUTPOST.

Violation: MINOR FOUL. If REPEATED, MAJOR FOUL.

122. **\*Don't abuse SCORING ELEMENTS.** Neither a ROBOT nor a HUMAN
     PLAYER may damage a SCORING ELEMENT.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. MAJOR FOUL if REPEATED in any subsequent
MATCHES during the event. If via a ROBOT and the Head REFEREE determines
that further damage is likely to occur, DISABLED. Corrective action
(such as eliminating sharp edges, removing the damaging MECHANISM,
and/or re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT may compete in
subsequent MATCHES.

SCORING ELEMENTS are expected to undergo a reasonable amount of wear and
tear as they are handled by ROBOTS, such as scratching or marking.
Routinely gouging, tearing off pieces, or marking SCORING ELEMENTS are
violations of this rule.

123. **Only score while in your ALLIANCE ZONE.** A ROBOT may not launch
     a SCORING ELEMENT into their HUB unless their BUMPERS are partially
     or fully within their ALLIANCE ZONE.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL

124. **Don't catch FUEL**. A ROBOT may not do either of the following
     with FUEL released by the HUB unless and until that FUEL contacts
     anything else besides that ROBOT or FUEL CONTROLLED by that ROBOT:

<!-- -->

A.  gain greater than MOMENTARY CONTROL of FUEL, or

<!-- -->

N.  push or redirect FUEL to a desired location or in a preferred
    direction.

> A ROBOT is in CONTROL of a SCORING ELEMENT if the SCORING ELEMENT is
> fully supported by or stuck in, on, or under the ROBOT.

Violation: MINOR FOUL. If strategic, MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD.

Examples of interaction with a SCORING ELEMENT that are not "CONTROL"
include, but are not limited to:

A.  "bulldozing" (inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while in
    the path of the ROBOT moving about the FIELD),

<!-- -->

E.  "deflecting" (being hit by a SCORING ELEMENT that bounces off a
    ROBOT and moves in a random direction.)

Examples of interaction which would be considered strategic include, but
are not limited to:

F.  intentionally sitting under the HUB to collect a large quantity of
    FUEL,

G.  intentionally sitting under the HUB in order to redirect FUEL into
    your ALLIANCE ZONE.

### ROBOT

125. **\*ROBOTS must be safe.** A ROBOT may not pose an undue hazard to
     a human, an ARENA element, or another ROBOT in the following ways:

<!-- -->

A.  the ROBOT or anything it CONTROLS, e.g. FUEL, contacts anything
    outside the FIELD except for MOMENTARY contact inside the CHUTE
    and/or the CORRAL,

<!-- -->

O.  its BUMPERS fail such that a segment completely detaches,

P.  a corner of its ROBOT PERIMETER is exposed,

Q.  its team number or ALLIANCE color are indeterminate,

R.  its BUMPERS leave the BUMPER ZONE (see R405) REPEATEDLY or for more
    than a MOMENTARY amount of time, or

S.  its operation or design is dangerous or unsafe.

Violation: DISABLED. Corrective action (such as repair of BUMPERS,
removing the unsafe MECHANISM, and/or re-inspection) may be required
before the ROBOT will be allowed to compete in subsequent MATCHES.

Examples of dangerous operation or designs that likely pose undue
hazards include, but are not limited to:

A.  uncontrolled motion that cannot be stopped by the DRIVE TEAM,

<!-- -->

H.  ROBOT parts "flailing" outside of the FIELD,

I.  ROBOTS dragging their battery, and

J.  ROBOTS that consistently extend outside the FIELD.

Please be conscious of REFEREES and FIELD STAFF working around the ARENA
who may be in close proximity to your ROBOT.

126. **\*Keep your BUMPERS low**. ROBOT extensions may not interact with
     the carpet, BUMPS, or TOWER BASE such that the BUMPERS are lifted
     out of the BUMPER ZONE (see [R405]{.underline}).

Violation: MINOR FOUL. Corrective action (such as removing the offending
MECHANISM, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will
be allowed to compete in subsequent MATCHES.

127. **Don't damage the FIELD**. A ROBOT may not damage FIELD elements.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. If the Head REFEREE infers that additional
damage is likely, DISABLED. YELLOW CARD for any subsequent damage during
the event.

Corrective action (such as eliminating sharp edges, removing the
damaging MECHANISM, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the
ROBOT will be allowed to compete in subsequent MATCHES.

128. **Watch your FIELD interaction.** A ROBOT is prohibited from the
     following interactions with FIELD elements (with the exception of
     the RUNGS and UPRIGHTS):

<!-- -->

A.  grabbing,

<!-- -->

T.  grasping,

U.  attaching to (including the use of a vacuum or hook fastener to
    anchor to the FIELD carpet),

V.  becoming entangled with, and

W.  suspending from.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL, plus YELLOW CARD if REPEATED, or longer than
MOMENTARY. If the Head REFEREE infers that damage is likely, DISABLED.
Corrective action (such as removing the offending MECHANISM, and/or
re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will be allowed to
compete in subsequent MATCHES.

129. **Expansion limits.** A ROBOT may not extend beyond any of the
     horizontal or vertical expansion limits described in
     [R105]{.underline}, [R106]{.underline}, and [R107]{.underline}.

If the over-expansion is due to damage and not used for strategic
benefit, it is an exception to this rule, and no penalty is imposed.

Violation: MINOR FOUL, or MAJOR FOUL if the over-expansion is used for
strategic benefit, including if it impedes or enables a scoring action.
Corrective action (such as removing the offending MECHANISM, and/or
re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will be allowed to
compete in subsequent MATCHES.

The intent of the exception to this rule is to prevent piling on a
punitive response to a ROBOT that's already experienced hardship and not
leveraging that hardship for gain. Examples for this rule include the
following:

A.  a physical device on a team's ROBOT, whose purpose is to restrain
    their TOWER mechanism from extending beyond the limit, breaks after
    a collision with another ROBOT. Provided the ROBOT does not use the
    now-too-long extension to climb the TOWER, no violation is assigned.

<!-- -->

K.  a vertical structural member of a ROBOT breaks at the bottom and
    rotates out such that it exceeds the limit imposed. The ROBOT then
    parks such that its extension blocks opponent ROBOTS from reaching
    the OUTPOST. A MAJOR FOUL is issued.

<!-- -->

130. **Don't Climb on each other.** ROBOTS may not fully support the
     weight of other ROBOTS on their ALLIANCE to climb the TOWER.

Violation: Supported ROBOTS become ineligible for TOWER points for the
remainder of the MATCH.

### Opponent Interaction

Note, [G415]{.underline}, [G416]{.underline}, [G417]{.underline} are
mutually exclusive. A single ROBOT to ROBOT interaction which violates
more than 1 of these rules results in the most punitive penalty, and
only the most punitive penalty, being assessed.

131. **\*Stay out of other ROBOTS.** A ROBOT may not use a COMPONENT
     outside its ROBOT PERIMETER (except its BUMPERS) to initiate
     contact with an opponent ROBOT inside the vertical projection of
     the opponent's ROBOT PERIMETER.

Violation: MINOR FOUL.

For the purposes of this rule, "initiate contact" requires movement
towards an opponent ROBOT.

In a collision, it's possible for both ROBOTS to initiate contact.

132. **\*This isn't combat robotics.** A ROBOT may not damage or
     functionally impair an opponent ROBOT in either of the following
     ways:

<!-- -->

A.  deliberately.

<!-- -->

X.  regardless of intent, by initiating contact, either directly or
    transitively via a SCORING ELEMENT CONTROLLED by the ROBOT, inside
    the vertical projection of an opponent's ROBOT PERIMETER.

Damage or functional impairment because of contact with a tipped-over
opponent ROBOT, which is not perceived by a REFEREE to be deliberate, is
not a violation of this rule.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD, or if opponent ROBOT is unable to
drive, then MAJOR FOUL and RED CARD.

*FIRST* Robotics Competition can be a full-contact competition and may
include rigorous game play. While this rule aims to limit severe damage
to ROBOTS, teams should design their ROBOTS to be robust.

Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to:

A.  A ROBOT leaves an arm extended, spins around to change course, and
    unintentionally hits and damages a COMPONENT inside the ROBOT
    PERIMETER of a nearby opponent ROBOT.

<!-- -->

L.  A ROBOT, in the process of trying to quickly reverse direction, tips
    up on a single pair of wheels, lands atop an opponent ROBOT, and
    damages a COMPONENT inside that opponent's ROBOT PERIMETER.

M.  A ROBOT high-speed rams and/or REPEATEDLY smashes an opponent ROBOT
    and causes damage. The REFEREE infers that the ROBOT was
    deliberately trying to damage the opponent's ROBOT.

Examples of functionally impairing another ROBOT include, but are not
limited to:

N.  opening an opponent's relief valve such that the opponent's air
    pressure drops and

O.  powering off an opponent's ROBOT (this example also clearly results
    in a RED CARD because the ROBOT is no longer able to drive).

At the conclusion of the MATCH, the Head REFEREE may elect to visually
inspect a ROBOT to confirm violations of this rule made during a MATCH
and remove the violation if the damage cannot be verified.

For the purposes of this rule, "initiating contact" requires movement
towards an opponent ROBOT.

In a collision, it's possible for both ROBOTS to initiate contact.

\"Unable to drive\" means that because of the incident, the DRIVER can
no longer drive to a desired location in a reasonable time (generally).
For example, if a ROBOT can only move in circles, or can only move
extremely slowly, the ROBOT is considered unable to drive.

133. **\*Don't tip or entangle.** A ROBOT may not deliberately, attach
     to, tip, or entangle with an opponent ROBOT.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD, or if CONTINUOUS or opponent
ROBOT is unable to drive, then MAJOR FOUL and RED CARD.

Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to:

A.  using a wedge-like MECHANISM to tip over opponent ROBOTS,

<!-- -->

P.  making BUMPER-to-BUMPER contact with an opponent ROBOT that is
    attempting to right itself after previously falling over and causing
    them to fall over again, and

Q.  causing an opponent ROBOT to tip over by contacting the ROBOT after
    it starts to tip if, in the judgement of the REFEREE, that contact
    could have been avoided.

Tipping as an unintended consequence of normal ROBOT to ROBOT
interaction, including single BUMPER to BUMPER hits that result in a
ROBOT tipping, is not a violation of this rule.

\"Unable to drive\" means that because of the incident, the DRIVER can
no longer drive to a desired location in a reasonable time (generally).
For example, if a ROBOT can only move in circles, or can only move
extremely slowly, the ROBOT is considered unable to drive.

134. **\*There's a 3-count on PINS.** A ROBOT may not PIN an opponent's
     ROBOT for more than 3 seconds. A ROBOT is PINNING if it is
     preventing the movement of an opponent ROBOT by contact, either
     direct or transitive (such as against a FIELD element). A PIN count
     ends once any of the following criteria below are met:

<!-- -->

A.  the ROBOTS have separated by at least 72.0in (1.83m) from each other
    for more than 3 seconds,

<!-- -->

Y.  either ROBOT has moved 72.0in (1.83m) from where the PIN initiated
    for more than 3 seconds, or

Z.  the PINNING ROBOT gets PINNED.

> For criteria A, the PIN count pauses once ROBOTS are separated by
> 72.0in (1.83m) until either the PIN ends or the PINNING ROBOT moves
> back within 72.0in (1.83m), at which point the PIN count is resumed.

For criteria B, the PIN count pauses once either ROBOT has moved 72.0in
(1.83m) from where the PIN initiated until the PIN ends or until both
ROBOTS move back within 72.0in (1.83m), at which point the PIN count is
resumed.

Violation: MINOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is
not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed.

A team's desired direction of travel is not a consideration when
determining if a ROBOT is PINNED.

135. **\*Don't collude with your partners to shut down major parts of
     game play.** 2 or more ROBOTS that appear to a REFEREE to be
     working together may not isolate or close off any major element of
     MATCH play.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is
not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed.

Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to:

A.  shutting down access to all SCORING ELEMENTS,

<!-- -->

R.  quarantining all opponents to a small area of the FIELD,

S.  preventing access to the opponent's TOWER,

T.  preventing access to a field zone by blocking both TRENCHES, and

U.  preventing access to a field zone by blocking both BUMPS.

Examples of standard gameplay that are not violations, include, but are
not limited to:

V.  A single ROBOT blocking access to a particular area of the FIELD,
    and

W.  2 ROBOTS independently collecting SCORING ELEMENTS in front of a
    BUMP or TRENCH at the same time.

<!-- -->

136. **TOWER protection.** A ROBOT may not contact, directly or
     transitively through a SCORING ELEMENT, an opponent ROBOT in
     contact with an opponent TOWER during the last 30 seconds of the
     MATCH regardless of who initiates contact.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL and if the opponent ROBOT is off the ground the
opponent ROBOT is awarded LEVEL 3 TOWER points.

Transitive contact requires that each robot is contacting the same
SCORING ELEMENT(S) simultaneously.

### Human

137. **\*No wandering.** A DRIVE TEAM member must remain in their
     designated area as follows:

<!-- -->

A.  DRIVERS and DRIVE COACHES may not contact anything outside their
    ALLIANCE AREA,

<!-- -->

A.  a DRIVER must use the OPERATOR CONSOLE in the DRIVER STATION to
    which they are assigned, as indicated on the team sign,

B.  a HUMAN PLAYER may not contact anything outside their ALLIANCE AREA,
    and

C.  a TECHNICIAN may not contact anything outside their designated area.

Exceptions are granted as follows:

D.  for a HUMAN PLAYER partially outside the ALLIANCE AREA,

E.  in cases concerning safety, and

F.  for actions that are inadvertent, MOMENTARY, and inconsequential.

Violation: MINOR FOUL.

An intent of item B is to prevent unsafe situations where long tethers
to OPERATOR CONSOLE devices increase tripping hazards as the operator
moves about the ALLIANCE AREA. In the interest of avoiding nuisance
penalties associated with a DRIVE TEAM member stepping outside of a
prescribed area, we prefer to offer a general guideline as to what it
means to use the OPERATOR CONSOLE in the ALLIANCE AREA. Provided the
DRIVE TEAM member is within close proximity of their DRIVER STATION,
there will be no repercussions. However, a DRIVE TEAM member located
more than approximately half a DRIVER STATION width away from their own
DRIVER STATION while using their OPERATOR CONSOLE is likely violating
this rule.

138. **\*DRIVE COACHES and other teams: hands off the controls.** A
     ROBOT shall be operated only by the DRIVERS and/or HUMAN PLAYERS of
     that team. A DRIVE COACH activating their E-Stop or A-Stop is the
     exception to this rule.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL. RED CARD if greater-than-MOMENTARY.

Exceptions may be made before a MATCH for major conflicts, e.g.
religious holidays, major testing, transportations issues, etc.

139. **\*DRIVE TEAMS, watch your reach.** A DRIVE TEAM member may not
     extend:

<!-- -->

A.  into the CHUTE beyond the ALLIANCE-colored tape line while the CHUTE
    DOOR is open, or

<!-- -->

G.  into the CORRAL beyond the ALLIANCE-colored tape line.

Violation: MINOR FOUL.

Teams should be careful when placing or collecting SCORING ELEMENTS and
be aware of [G101]{.underline}.

140. **\*Humans: use SCORING ELEMENTS as directed.** A DRIVE TEAM member
     may not deliberately use a SCORING ELEMENT in an attempt to ease or
     amplify a challenge associated with a FIELD element.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL.

An example of a violation of this rule is if a HUMAN PLAYER uses a FUEL
to disrupt an opponent ROBOT attempting to climb on the TOWER.

141. **\*SCORING ELEMENT delivery.** FUEL may only be introduced to the
     FIELD by a HUMAN PLAYER or DRIVER in the following ways:

<!-- -->

A.  through the CHUTE,

<!-- -->

H.  through the bottom opening in the OUTPOST, or

I.  thrown from the OUTPOST AREA.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL.

142. **\*DRIVE COACHES, SCORING ELEMENTS are off limits.** DRIVE COACHES
     may not touch SCORING ELEMENTS, unless for safety purposes.

Violation: MINOR FOUL.

143. **The OUTPOST has a storage limit.** Off-FIELD FUEL may only be
     stored in the CHUTE and the CORRAL. Excess FUEL, defined as the
     CHUTE & CORRAL being full, must immediately be entered onto the
     FIELD.

     HUMAN PLAYERS making a good-faith effort to immediately move or
     enter additional FUEL is an exception to this rule.

Violation: MINOR FOUL, and if CONTINUOUS, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed.

## Post-MATCH

501. **\*Leave promptly.** A DRIVE TEAM member may not cause significant
     or multiple delays to the start of a subsequent MATCH, scheduled
     break content, or other FIELD activities.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations at any
point during the event.

# ROBOT Construction Rules (R)

The rules listed below explicitly address legal parts and materials and
how those parts and materials may be used on a REBUILT ROBOT. A ROBOT is
an electromechanical assembly built by the *FIRST* Robotics Competition
team to play the current season's game and includes all the basic
systems required to be an active participant in the game --power,
communications, control, BUMPERS, and movement about the FIELD. A BUMPER
is a protective assembly designed to attach to the exterior of the ROBOT
and constructed as specified in section [8.4 BUMPER Rules]{.underline}.

There are many reasons for the structure of the rules, including safety,
reliability, parity, creation of a reasonable design challenge,
adherence to professional standards, impact on the competition, and
compatibility with the [[Kit of Parts
(KOP)]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/resources/library/frc/kit-of-parts).
The KOP is the collection of items listed on the current season's
Kickoff Kit Checklists, distributed to the team via *FIRST* Choice in
the current season, or paid for completely (except shipping) with a
Product Donation Voucher (PDV) from the current season.

Another intent of these rules is to have all energy sources and active
actuation systems on the ROBOT (e.g. batteries, compressors, motors,
servos, cylinders, and their controllers) drawn from a well-defined set
of options. This is to ensure that all teams have access to the same
actuation resources and that the INSPECTORS are able to accurately and
efficiently assess the legality of a given part.

ROBOTS are made up of COMPONENTS and MECHANISMS. A COMPONENT is any part
in its most basic configuration, which cannot be disassembled without
damaging or destroying the part or altering its fundamental function. A
MECHANISM is an assembly of COMPONENTS that provide specific
functionality on the ROBOT. A MECHANISM can be disassembled (and then
reassembled) into individual COMPONENTS without damage to the parts.

Many rules in this section reference Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)
items. A COTS item must be a standard (i.e. not custom order) part
commonly available from a VENDOR for all teams for purchase. To be a
COTS item, the COMPONENT or MECHANISM must be in an unaltered,
unmodified state (with the exception of installation or modification of
any software). Items that are no longer commercially available but are
functionally equivalent to the original condition as delivered from the
VENDOR are considered COTS and may be used.

Example 1: A team orders 2 ROBOT grippers from RoboHands Corp. and
receives both items. They put 1 in their storeroom and plan to use it
later. Into the other, they drill "lightening holes" to reduce weight.
The first gripper is still classified as a COTS item, but the second
gripper is now a FABRICATED ITEM, as it has been modified.

Example 2: A team obtains openly available blueprints of a drive module
commonly available from Wheels-R-Us Inc. and has local machine shop
"We-Make-It, Inc." manufacture a copy of the part for them. The produced
part is not a COTS item, because it is not commonly carried as part of
the standard stock of We-Make-It, Inc.

Example 3: A team obtains openly available design drawings from a
professional publication during the pre-season and uses them to
fabricate a gearbox for their ROBOT during the build period following
Kickoff. The design drawings are considered a COTS item and may be used
as "raw material" to fabricate the gearbox. The finished gearbox itself
would be a FABRICATED ITEM, and not a COTS item.

Example 4: A COTS part that has non-functional label markings added
would still be considered a COTS part, but a COTS part that has
device-specific mounting holes added is a FABRICATED ITEM.

Example 5: A team has a COTS single-board processor version 1.0, which
can no longer be purchased. Only the COTS single-board processor version
2.0 may be purchased. If the COTS single-board processor version 1.0 is
functionally equivalent to its original condition, it may be used.

Example 6: A team has a COTS gearbox which has been discontinued. If the
COTS gearbox is functionally equivalent to its original condition, it
may be used.

A VENDOR is a legitimate business source for COTS items that satisfies
all the following criteria:

A.  has a Federal Tax Identification number. In cases where the VENDOR
    is outside of the United States, they must possess an equivalent
    form of registration or license with the government of their home
    nation that establishes and validates their status as a legitimate
    business licensed to operate within that country.

<!-- -->

Q.  is not a "wholly owned subsidiary" of a *FIRST* Robotics Competition
    team or collection of teams. While there may be some individuals
    affiliated with both a team and the VENDOR, the business and
    activities of the team and VENDOR must be completely separable.

R.  should maintain sufficient stock or production capability so they
    are able to ship any general (i.e., non-*FIRST* unique) product
    within 5 business days of receiving a valid purchase request. It is
    recognized that certain unusual circumstances (such as such as a
    global supply chain disruption and/or 1,000 *FIRST* teams all
    ordering the same part at once from the same VENDOR) may cause
    atypical delays in shipping due to backorders for even the largest
    VENDORS. Such delays due to higher-than-normal order rates are
    excused. This criterion may not apply to custom-built items from a
    source that is both a VENDOR and a fabricator.

For example, a VENDOR may sell flexible belting that the team wishes to
procure to use as treads on their drive system. The VENDOR cuts the
belting to a custom length from standard shelf stock that is typically
available, welds it into a loop to make a tread, and ships it to a team.
The fabrication of the tread takes the VENDOR 2 weeks. This would be
considered a FABRICATED ITEM, and the 2-week ship time is acceptable.
Alternately, the team may decide to fabricate the treads themselves. To
satisfy this criterion, the VENDOR would just have to ship a length of
belting from shelf stock (i.e. a COTS item) to the team within 5
business days and leave the welding of the cuts to the team.

S.  makes their products available to all *FIRST* Robotics Competition
    teams. A VENDOR must not limit supply or make a product available to
    just a limited number of *FIRST* Robotics Competition teams.

The intent of this definition is to be as inclusive as possible to
permit access to all legitimate sources, while preventing ad hoc
organizations from providing special-purpose products to a limited
subset of teams in an attempt to circumvent the cost accounting rules.

*FIRST* desires to permit teams to have the broadest choice of
legitimate sources possible, and to obtain COTS items from the sources
that provide them with the best prices and level of service available.
Teams also need to protect against long delays in availability of parts
that will impact their ability to complete their ROBOT. The build season
is brief, so the VENDOR must be able to get their product, particularly
*FIRST* unique items, to a team in a timely manner.

Ideally, chosen VENDORS should have national distributors (e.g. Home
Depot, Lowes, MSC, McMaster-Carr, etc.). Remember, *FIRST* Robotics
Competition events are not always near home -- when parts fail, local
access to replacement materials is often critical.

A FABRICATED ITEM is any COMPONENT or MECHANISM that has been altered,
built, cast, constructed, concocted, created, cut, heat treated,
machined, manufactured, modified, painted, produced, surface coated, or
conjured partially or completely into the final form in which it will be
used on the ROBOT.

Note that it is possible for an item (typically raw materials) to be
neither COTS nor a FABRICATED ITEM. For example, a 120.0in (3.048m)
length of aluminum which has been cut into 60.0in (1.52m) pieces by the
team for storage or transport is neither COTS (it's not in the state
received from the VENDOR), nor a FABRICATED ITEM (the cuts were not made
to advance the part towards its final form on the ROBOT).

Teams may be asked to provide documentation proving the legality of
non-REBUILT KOP items during inspection where a rule specifies limits
for a legal part (e.g. pneumatic items, current limits, COTS
electronics, etc.).

Some of these rules make use of English unit requirements for parts. If
your team has a question about a metric-equivalent part's legality,
please e-mail your question to the *FIRST* Robotics Competition Kit of
Parts team at
[[frcparts@firstinspires.org]{.underline}](mailto:frcparts@firstinspires.org)
for an official ruling. To seek approval for alternate devices for
inclusion in future *FIRST* Robotics Competition seasons, please contact
the Kit of Parts team at
[[frcparts@firstinspires.org]{.underline}](mailto:frcparts@firstinspires.org)
with item specifications.

Teams should acknowledge the support provided by the corporate sponsors
and mentors with an appropriate display of their school and sponsors
names and/or logos (or the name of the supporting youth organization, if
appropriate).

*FIRST* Robotics Competition can be a full-contact competition and may
include rigorous game play. While the rules aim to limit severe damage
to ROBOTS, teams should design their ROBOTS to be robust.

## General ROBOT Design

101. **\*ROBOT PERIMETER must be fixed.** The ROBOT (excluding BUMPERS)
     must have a ROBOT PERIMETER, contained within the BUMPER ZONE and
     established while in the ROBOT'S STARTING CONFIGURATION, that is
     comprised of fixed, non-articulated structural elements of the
     ROBOT. Minor protrusions no greater than 0.25in (0.64cm) such as
     bolt heads, fastener ends, weld beads, and rivets are not
     considered part of the ROBOT PERIMETER.

To determine the ROBOT PERIMETER, wrap a piece of string around the
outer most parts of the ROBOT (excluding BUMPERS) at the BUMPER ZONE
described in [R405]{.underline} and pull it taut. The string outlines
the ROBOT PERIMETER.

Example: A ROBOT'S chassis is shaped like the letter 'U', with a large
gap between chassis elements on the front of the ROBOT. When wrapping a
taut string around this chassis, the string extends across the gap and
the resulting ROBOT PERIMETER is a rectangle with 4 sides.

Figure ‑ ROBOT PERIMETER example

![Figure showing ROBOT PERIMETER example.
](./game-manual/media/media/image49.png){width="3.6979483814523184in"
height="1.6234897200349956in"}

102. **\*STARTING CONFIGURATION -- no overhang.** In the STARTING
     CONFIGURATION (the physical configuration in which a ROBOT starts a
     MATCH), no part of the ROBOT shall extend outside the vertical
     projection of the ROBOT PERIMETER, with the exception of its
     BUMPERS and minor protrusions such as bolt heads, fastener ends,
     rivets, cable ties, etc.

If a ROBOT is designed as intended and each side is pushed up against a
vertical wall (in STARTING CONFIGURATION and with BUMPERS removed), only
the ROBOT PERIMETER (or minor protrusions) will be in contact with the
wall.

The allowance for minor protrusions in this rule is intended to allow
protrusions that are both minor in extension from the ROBOT PERIMETER
and cross-sectional area.

If a ROBOT uses interchangeable MECHANISMS per [I103]{.underline}, Teams
should be prepared to show compliance with this rule and
[R105]{.underline} in all configurations.

103. **\*ROBOT weight limit.** The ROBOT weight must not exceed 115.0lb
     (52.16kg). When determining weight, the basic ROBOT structure and
     all elements of all additional MECHANISMS that might be used in a
     single configuration of the ROBOT shall be weighed together (see
     I103).\
     For the purposes of determining compliance with the weight
     limitations, the following items are excluded:

<!-- -->

A.  ROBOT BUMPERS,

<!-- -->

J.  ROBOT battery and its associated half of the Anderson cable quick
    connect/disconnect pair (including wire, the associated cable lugs,
    connecting bolts, and insulation), and

K.  tags used for location detection systems if provided by the event.

<!-- -->

104. **STARTING CONFIGURATION -- max size.** A ROBOT'S STARTING
     CONFIGURATION may not have a ROBOT PERIMETER greater than 110.0in
     (2.794m) and may not be more than 30in (76.2cm) tall.

Be sure to consider the size of the ROBOT on its cart to make sure it
will fit through doors. Also consider the size of the ROBOT to ensure
that it will fit into a shipping crate, vehicle, etc.

Note that rules contained in section [8.4 BUMPER Rules]{.underline} may
impose additional restrictions on ROBOT design.

105. **ROBOT horizontal extension limit.** ROBOTS may not extend more
     than 12in (30.48cm) beyond the vertical projection of their ROBOT
     PERIMETER.

<figure>
<img src="./game-manual/media/media/image50.png"
style="width:3.16736in;height:2.725in"
alt="Figure showing ROBOT PERIMETER extension" />
<figcaption><p>ROBOT PERIMETER extension</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Teams should expect to have to demonstrate a ROBOT'S ability to
constrain itself per above during inspection. Constraints may be
implemented with either hardware or software.

106. **Horizontal extension -- one direction at a time.** ROBOTS may not
     extend beyond their ROBOT PERIMETER in more than one direction
     (i.e. over more than 1 side of the ROBOT) at a time. The extension
     may not reach outside the projection of that side of the ROBOT
     PERIMETER.\
     For the purposes of this rule, a round or circular section of FRAME
     PERIMETER is considered to have an infinite number of sides.
     MOMENTARY and inconsequential extensions in multiple directions are
     an exception to this rule.

Examples of MOMENTARY and inconsequential actions include a wire or
cable tie swinging out of the ROBOT PERIMETER, including while an
extension is deployed out a different side.

Examples of compliance and non-compliance of this rule are shown in
[Figure 8‑3]{.underline}.

Yellow bars represent the limits of the ROBOT PERIMETER and are drawn in
the same orientation of the ROBOT'S PERIMETER.

Green bars represent a measured extension from the ROBOT PERIMETER that
does not exceed the limit defined in [R105]{.underline}.

- ROBOT A violates this rule for extending in more than one direction

- ROBOT B violates this rule for extending in more than one direction

- ROBOT C does not violate this rule

- ROBOT D does not violate this rule as the additional extension is
  momentary and inconsequential

- ROBOT E does not violate this rule

- ROBOT F violates this rule for extending in more than one direction by
  extending over a round segment of ROBOT PERIMETER.

Figure ‑ Examples of compliance and non-compliance of this rule

![Figure showing compliance and non-compliance examples of extensions.
](./game-manual/media/media/image51.png){width="4.047169728783902in"
height="5.858799212598425in"}

107. **ROBOT vertical extension limit.** ROBOTS may not extend such that
     their total height exceeds 30.0in (76.2cm).

> This measurement is intended to be made as if the ROBOT is resting on
> a flat floor (without changing the ROBOT configuration), not relative
> to the current height of the ROBOT from the FIELD carpet at any given
> time (i.e. the measurement is made perpendicular to the ROBOT
> PERIMETER polygon).

108. **ROBOT extension floor interaction** ROBOT extensions may not
     interact with the carpet, BUMPS, or TOWER BASE such that the
     BUMPERS are lifted out of the BUMPER ZONE (see R405).

## ROBOT Safety & Damage Prevention

201. **\*No digging into carpet.** Traction devices must not have
     surface features that could damage the ARENA (e.g. metal,
     sandpaper, inflexible studs, cleats, hook-loop fasteners or similar
     attachments). Traction devices include all parts of the ROBOT that
     are designed to transmit any propulsive and/or braking forces
     between the ROBOT and FIELD carpet.

<!-- -->

109. **\*No exposed sharp edges.** Protrusions from the ROBOT and
     exposed surfaces on the ROBOT shall not pose hazards to the ARENA
     elements (including SCORING ELEMENTS) or people.

Note that the use of acrylic or other materials which may break into
jagged pieces is not explicitly prohibited, but any such breakage must
be corrected immediately to comply with this rule.

110. **\*General safety.** ROBOT parts shall not be made from hazardous
     materials, be unsafe, cause an unsafe condition, or interfere with
     the operation of other ROBOTS.

Examples of items that will violate this rule include (but are not
limited to):

A.  shields, curtains, or any other devices or materials designed or
    used to obstruct or limit the vision of any DRIVE TEAM members
    and/or interfere with their ability to safely control their ROBOT,

<!-- -->

X.  speakers, sirens, air horns, or other audio devices that generate
    sound at a level sufficient to be a distraction,

Y.  any devices or decorations specifically intended to jam or interfere
    with the remote sensing capabilities of another ROBOT, including
    vision systems, acoustic range finders, sonars, infrared proximity
    detectors, etc. (e.g. including imagery on your ROBOT that utilizes
    or closely mimics 36h11 AprilTags),

Z.  lasers other than those listed as IEC/EN 60825-1 "Class 1" or IEC/EN
    62471 "Exempt,"

A.  flammable gasses,

B.  any device intended to produce flames or pyrotechnics,

C.  hydraulic fluids or hydraulic items,

D.  switches or contacts containing liquid mercury,

E.  circuitry used to create voltages in excess of 24 Volts,

F.  any ballast not secured sufficiently, including loose ballast e.g.
    sand, ball bearings, etc., such that it may become loose during a
    MATCH,

G.  hazardous materials (e.g. lead, whether encapsulated or not) used on
    the ROBOT,

H.  high intensity light sources used on the ROBOT (e.g. super bright
    LED sources marketed as 'military grade' or 'self-defense') may only
    be illuminated for a brief time while targeting and may need to be
    shrouded to prevent any exposure to participants. Complaints about
    the use of such light sources will be followed by re-inspection and
    possible disablement of the device, and

I.  Bright lights which flash more than approximately 5 times per
    second, per [E108]{.underline}.

<!-- -->

111. **\*Leave SCORING ELEMENTS at the FIELD.** ROBOTS must allow
     removal of SCORING ELEMENTS from the ROBOT and the ROBOT from FIELD
     elements while DISABLED and powered off.

ROBOTS will not be re-enabled after the MATCH, so teams must be sure
that SCORING ELEMENTS and ROBOTS can be quickly, simply, and safely
removed.

Teams are encouraged to consider [G501]{.underline} when developing
their ROBOTS.

112. **\*Don't contaminate the FIELD.** Liquids, gels, greases and fine
     particles must not contaminate the FIELD or other ROBOTS.

113. **\*Don't damage SCORING ELEMENTS.** ROBOT elements likely to come
     in contact with a SCORING ELEMENT shall not pose a significant
     hazard to the SCORING ELEMENT.

SCORING ELEMENTS are expected to undergo a reasonable amount of wear and
tear as they are handled by ROBOTS, such as scratching or marking.
Gouging, tearing off pieces, or routinely marking SCORING ELEMENTS are
violations of this rule.

## Budget Constraints & Fabrication Schedule

301. **\*Individual item cost limit.** No individual, non-KOP item or
     software shall have a Fair Market Value (FMV) that exceeds \$600
     USD. The total cost of COMPONENTS purchased in bulk may exceed
     \$600 USD as long as the cost of an individual COMPONENT does not
     exceed \$600 USD.

Teams should be ready to show INSPECTORS documentation of FMV for any
COMPONENTS that appear to be in the range of the \$600 USD limit.

The Analog Devices IMU MXP Breakout Board, P/N ADIS16448, does not have
a published FMV. This device is considered to comply with this rule
regardless of its true FMV.

The FMV of a COTS item is its price defined by a VENDOR for the part or
an identical functional replacement. This price must be generally
available to all *FIRST* Robotics Competition teams throughout the build
and competition season (i.e. short-term sale prices or coupons do not
reflect FMV), however teams are only expected to make a good faith
effort at determining the item price and are not expected to monitor
prices of ROBOT items throughout the season. The FMV is the cost of the
item itself and does not include any duties, taxes, tariffs, shipping,
or other costs that may vary by locality.

The FMV of COTS software is the price, set by the VENDOR, to license the
software (or piece of the software) that runs on the ROBOT for the
period from Kickoff to the end of the *FIRST* Championship. The FMV of
software licensed free-of-cost, including through the Virtual KOP, for
use on the ROBOT is \$0.

The FMV of FABRICATED parts is the value of the material and/or labor,
except for labor provided by team members (including sponsor employees
who are members of the team), members of other teams, and/or event
provided machine shops. Material costs are accounted for as the cost of
any purchasable quantity that can be used to make the individual part
(i.e. the purchasable raw material is larger than the FABRICATED part).

Example 1: A team orders a custom bracket made by a company to the
team\'s specification. The company's material cost and normally charged
labor rate apply.

Example 2: A team receives a donated sensor. The company would normally
sell this item for \$450 USD, which is therefore its FMV.

Example 3: A team purchases titanium tube stock for \$400 USD and has it
machined by a local machine shop. The machine shop is not considered a
team sponsor but donates 2 hours of expended labor anyway. The team must
include the estimated normal cost of the labor as if it were paid to the
machine shop and add it to the \$400 USD.

Example 4: A team purchases titanium tube stock for \$400 USD and has it
machined by a local machine shop that is a recognized sponsor of the
team. If the machinists are considered members of the team, their labor
costs do not apply. The total applicable cost for the part would be
\$400 USD.

It is in the best interests of the teams and *FIRST* to form
relationships with as many organizations as possible. Recognizing
supporting companies as sponsors of, and members in, the team is
encouraged, even if the involvement of the sponsor is solely through the
donation of fabrication labor.

Example 5: A team purchases titanium tube stock for \$400 USD and has it
machined by another team. The total applicable cost for the part would
be \$400 USD.

Example 6: A team purchases a widget at a garage sale or online auction
for \$300, but it's available for sale from a VENDOR for \$700. The FMV
is \$700.

If a COTS item is part of a modular system that can be assembled in
several possible configurations, then each individual module must fit
within the price constraints defined in this rule.

If the modules are designed to assemble into a single configuration, and
the assembly is functional in only that configuration, then the total
cost of the complete assembly including all modules must fit within the
price constraints defined in this rule.

In summary, if a VENDOR sells a system or a kit, a team must use the
entire system/kit FMV and not the value of its COMPONENT pieces.

Example 7: VENDOR A sells a gearbox that can be used with a number of
different gear sets, and can mate with 2 different motors they sell. A
team purchases the gearbox, a gear set, and a motor, then assembles them
together. Each part is treated separately for the purpose of determining
FMV since the purchased pieces can each be used in various
configurations.

Example 8: VENDOR B sells a robotic arm assembly that a team wants to
use. However, it costs \$630 USD, so they cannot use it. The VENDOR
sells the "hand", "wrist", and "arm" as separate assemblies, for \$210
USD each. A team wishes to purchase the 3 items separately, then
reassemble them. This would not be legal, as they are really buying and
using the entire assembly, which has a Fair Market Value of \$630 USD.

Example 9: VENDOR C sells a set of wheels or wheel modules that are
often used in groups of 4. The wheels or modules can be used in other
quantities or configurations. A team purchases 4 and uses them in the
most common configuration. Each part is treated separately for the
purpose of determining FMV, since the purchased pieces can be used in
various configurations.

114. **\*MAJOR MECHANISM, from this year only.** MAJOR MECHANISMS, as
     defined in [I101]{.underline}, created before Kickoff are not
     permitted.

Neither this rule nor the language in this blue box define specific
thresholds for how much of a MAJOR MECHANISM must be constructed after
Kickoff. This rule expects and requires the team's honest assessment of
whether they built the MAJOR MECHANISMS of their ROBOT after Kickoff.

Attempts to exploit loopholes in the definition of MAJOR MECHANISM in
order to bypass this requirement are in the spirit of neither this rule
nor *FIRST* Robotics Competition. Examples of exploitation include:

A.  Pre-assembling significant portions of a MAJOR MECHANISM prior to
    Kickoff and attaching those assemblies together post-Kickoff,

<!-- -->

J.  Removing a small COMPONENT of a MAJOR MECHANISM prior to Kickoff
    such that it is no longer a MAJOR MECHANISM and replacing it after
    Kickoff.

<!-- -->

115. **\*Create new designs and software, unless they're public.** ROBOT
     software and designs created before Kickoff are only permitted if
     the source files (complete information sufficient to produce the
     design) are available publicly prior to Kickoff.

Example 1: A team realizes that the transmission designed and built in
the fall perfectly fits their need for a transmission to drive the ROBOT
arm. They build an exact copy of the transmission from the original
design plans and bolt it to the ROBOT. This would be prohibited, as the
transmission -- although made during the competition season -- was built
from detailed designs developed prior to Kickoff.

Example 2: A team developed an omni-directional drive system for the
2019 competition. In July 2019 they refined and improved the control
software, written in C++, to add more precision and capabilities. They
decided to use a similar system for the REBUILT competition. They copied
large sections of unmodified code over into the control software of the
new ROBOT, also written in C++. This would be a violation of the
schedule constraint and is not allowed.

Example 3: The same team decides to use LabVIEW as their software
environment for REBUILT. Following Kickoff, they use the previously
developed C++ code as a reference for the algorithms and calculations
required to implement their omni-directional control solution. Because
they developed new LabVIEW code as they ported over their algorithms,
this is permitted.

Example 4: A different team develops a similar solution during the fall
and plans to use the developed software on their competition ROBOT.
After completing the software, they post it in a generally accessible
public forum and make the code available to all teams. Because they have
made their software publicly available before Kickoff, they can use it
on their ROBOT.

Example 5: A team develops a transmission prior to Kickoff. After
completing the project, they publish the CAD files on a generally
accessible public forum and make them available to all teams. Because
they have made the design publicly available before Kickoff, they can
use the design to create an identical transmission, fabricated after
Kickoff, for use on their REBUILT ROBOT.

## BUMPER Rules 

A BUMPER is a required assembly which attaches to the ROBOT frame.
BUMPERS protect ROBOTS from damaging/being damaged by other ROBOTS and
FIELD elements.

A BUMPER guide providing additional information on materials and design
based on historical best practices may be found under the Mechanical
Resources section of the [[Technical Resources
page](https://www.firstinspires.org/resources/library/frc/technical-resources).]{.underline}
Teams may also reference the [[KitBot
Instructions]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/resources/library/frc/kitbot)
for a detailed step-by-step on how to build bumpers for the KitBot.

All dimensions specified in this section are nominal and will be
measured during inspection with a tolerance of 0.25in (0.63cm) unless
otherwise specified. This means that maximums specified have a tolerance
of +0.25in (0.63cm) and minimums specified have a tolerance of --0.25in
(0.63cm). Teams are encouraged to design to the nominal dimension and
reserve the tolerance for unexpected deviation such as manufacturing
error or tolerance stack-up.

401. **\*BUMPERS almost all around.** ROBOTS are required to use BUMPERS
     to protect the entire ROBOT PERIMETER. Gaps of less than 1.25in
     (3.17cm) between adjacent segments are permitted as long as all
     corners are filled per R406. A single gap larger than 1.25in
     (3.17cm) is permitted, as long as at least 5.0in (12.7cm) of ROBOT
     PERIMETER on each side of each corner is protected by BUMPER.

An arc is considered to have infinite corners and therefore may not have
a gap larger than 1.25in (3.17cm).

BUMPER coverage requirements

![Image showing BUMPER coverage requirements

height="2.7999682852143484in"}

116. **\*BUMPER construction.** BUMPERS must consist of the following:

<!-- -->

A.  **Padding** -- A minimum of 2.25in (5.72cm) depth of foam padding,
    at least 4.5in (11.43cm) tall consisting of solid blocks, sheets, or
    stacked rods of one or more of the following materials:

    i.  Solid pool noodles or backer rod

    ii. Solid polyethylene closed cell foam (including crosslinked) with
        density between 1.5 and 3.0lb/ft^3^ (24.03 to 48.05kg/m^3^)

    iii. Solid EVA closed cell foam with density between 2.0 and
         6.0lb/ft^3^ (32.04 to 96.11kg/m^3^)

    iv. Foam floor tiles

> Multiple types, shapes, and/or layers of foam may be used within a
> single BUMPER.
>
> Teams should be prepared to provide information about the padding
> material used in their BUMPERS. Teams do not need to have a separate
> material sample or expose padding for direct inspection to show
> compliance with this rule.

B.  **Backing** -- A backer at least 4.5in (11.43cm) tall which supports
    the padding (i.e. padding is not cantilevered other than in corners)
    and facilitates installation and removal of the BUMPER from the
    ROBOT (as noted in [R410]{.underline}). Additional elements may be
    added to strengthen the backing, fill space between the BUMPER and
    ROBOT frame, serve as part of the attachment system, or for any
    other purpose.

height="2.4833333333333334in"}

C.  **Cover** -- Cloth (as noted in [R411]{.underline}) which covers all
    outward, upward and downward facing surfaces of padding such that no
    padding is exposed to interaction with the FIELD or other ROBOTs.

D.  **Fastening System** -- BUMPERS must attach to the ROBOT PERIMETER
    with a rigid fastening system to form a tight, robust connection to
    the main structure/frame (e.g. not attached with hook-and-loop tape,
    tape, or cable ties). The fastening system must be designed to
    withstand vigorous game play. All removable fasteners (e.g. bolts,
    locking pins, quick release pins, etc.) may be considered part of
    either the BUMPERS or ROBOT for determination of weight per
    [R103]{.underline} and [R408]{.underline}.

> The BUMPER Rules provide teams significant freedom in choosing designs
> and materials. For information on a reference design, see the Bumper
> Guide under the Mechanical Resources section of the [[Technical
> Resouces

BUMPER Cross Section Example

- ![Image showing BUMPER Cross-section

  height="3.066666666666667in"}

117. **\*BUMPER extension limit.** BUMPERS must not extend more than
     4.0in (10.16cm) from the ROBOT PERIMETER.

BUMPER Extension Limit

![Image showing BUMPER Cross-section and limit dimension from ROBOT
PERIMETER](./game-manual/media/media/image56.jpg){width="3.4916666666666667in"
height="3.4916666666666667in"}

118. **\*BUMPERS must be soft.** Hard parts of BUMPERS must not extend
     more than 1.25in (3.17cm) out from the ROBOT PERIMETER. Only
     padding (per [R402-A]{.underline}), cover (per
     [R402-C]{.underline}, including any coatings or markings), and soft
     fasteners used to secure padding or cover are permitted beyond this
     limit. Padding must extend at least 2.0in (5.08cm) beyond any hard
     parts of the BUMPER. There is no limit on how far BUMPER hard parts
     may extend inside the ROBOT FRAME PERIMETER.

BUMPER Hard Parts Limit

![Image showing BUMPER Hard Parts
Limit](./game-manual/media/media/image57.jpg){width="3.508918416447944in"
height="3.2909722222222224in"}

Hard parts include any items which are likely to cause damage to the
cloth or padding of other BUMPERS such as nuts and bolts, cable ties,
hard plastics, etc.

119. **\*BUMPERS interact with BUMPERS.** While navigating the FIELD
     normally, all BUMPERS must have padding (per [R402-A]{.underline})
     supported by backing (per [R402-B]{.underline}) entirely filling
     the BUMPER ZONE, a space between 2.5in (6.35cm) and 5.75in
     (14.61cm) from the floor.

BUMPER ZONE examples

![Image showing example of BUMPERS in the BUMPER
ZONE](./game-manual/media/media/image58.jpg){width="4.683333333333334in"
height="2.441666666666667in"}

This measurement is intended to be made in a ROBOT'S expected
configuration(s) while navigating the FIELD and is relative to whatever
surface the ROBOT is currently driving on. BUMPERS leaving the BUMPER
ZONE due to ROBOTS inadvertently tipping is not a violation of this
rule.

120. **\*****Fill BUMPER corners.** Corner joints between BUMPERS must
     be filled with uncompressed padding material extending at least
     2.25in (5.72cm) from the corner with no gaps or voids. Examples of
     implementation are shown in [Figure 8‑10]{.underline}.

Uncompressed corner padding

![Image showing examples of corner padding on
BUMPERS](./game-manual/media/media/image59.jpeg){width="5.472487970253718in"
height="4.549086832895888in"}

Separate bumper segments meeting at a miter in the corner are not
considered to "fill" the corner due to the cloth covering and do not
meet the requirements of this rule.

121. **\*BUMPERS shouldn't be wedges.** BUMPERS must not act as wedges
     when interacting with other BUMPERS.

Examples of BUMPERS which might act as a wedge, and may invite
additional scrutiny, include:

A.  BUMPERS utilizing softer foam towards the top of a BUMPER profile,

<!-- -->

K.  BUMPERS utilizing excessively rounded profiles such as a single
    semi-circle, and

L.  BUMPERS with tapered or stepped padding such that the padding is
    thinner or thicker towards the top or bottom.

<!-- -->

122. **\*Weight limit with BUMPERS.** The total weight of the ROBOT (as
     described in [R103]{.underline}) with BUMPERS must not exceed
     135.0lb (61.23kg)

123. **\*BUMPERS should be passive.** BUMPERS must be fixed relative to
     the ROBOT PERIMETER. BUMPERS may not contain any moving elements
     (beyond compression and flex of BUMPER materials) or electrical
     elements.

124. **\*BUMPERS must come off.** BUMPERS must be designed for
     installation and removal to facilitate inspection and weighing.

As a guideline, BUMPERS should be able to be installed or removed by 2
people in fewer than 5 minutes.

125. **\*BUMPERS indicate your ALLIANCE.** Each ROBOT must be able to
     display red or blue BUMPER covers to reflect their ALLIANCE color,
     as assigned in the MATCH schedule distributed at the event (as
     described in section [10.1 MATCH Schedules]{.underline}).
     Contrasting markings on outward, upward, or downward facing
     surfaces of the BUMPER cover, other than the following, are
     prohibited:

<!-- -->

A.  those required per [R412]{.underline},

<!-- -->

L.  hook-and-loop tape, snap fasteners, or functional equivalents backed
    by the hard parts of the BUMPER,

M.  solid white *FIRST* logos between 4.75in (12.06cm) and 5.25in
    (13.33cm) wide (i.e. comparable to those available in the REBUILT
    Virtual Kit), and

N.  narrow areas of underlying cloth exposed at seams, corners, or
    folds.

<!-- -->

126. **\*Team number on BUMPERS.** Team numbers must be displayed and
     positioned on the BUMPER cover in at least 3 locations
     approximately 90 degrees apart such that an observer walking around
     the perimeter of the ROBOT can unambiguously tell the team's number
     from most points of view, from as far as approximately 720.0in
     (18.29m). Team numbers must meet the following additional criteria:

<!-- -->

A.  consist of only white Arabic numerals at least 3.75in (9.53cm) high,
    at least 0.5in (1.27cm) in stroke width,

The 0.5in (1.27cm) stroke width requirement applies to the majority of
the stroke. Font elements less than 0.5in (1.27cm) such as serifs,
rounded edges, small hairlines or gaps, etc. are permitted as long as
the majority of the stroke meets the sizing requirement and the numbers
are unambiguous.

O.  must not wrap around sharp corners (less than 135.0°) of the ROBOT
    PERIMETER,

P.  must not split individual digits such that the team number is
    ambiguous, and

As a guideline, spacing between digits or groups of digits which exceeds
\~4.0in (10.16cm) may be ambiguous.

Q.  may not substitute logos or icons for numerals.

There is no prohibition against splitting team numbers onto different
sections of BUMPER. The intent is that the team's number is clearly
visible and unambiguous so that Judges, REFEREES, Announcers, and other
teams can easily identify competing ROBOTS.

This marking is intended to display the team number only, not to
intentionally change the surface characteristics of the BUMPER.
Excessive material usage as part of any team number marking will invite
close scrutiny.

: Motor allowances

For servos, note that the roboRIO is limited to a max current output of
2.2A on the 6V rail (12.4W of electrical input power). Teams should make
sure that their total servo power usage remains below this limit at all
times.

Servo mechanical output power is approximated by the following formula
(using 6V data reported by manufacturer): Mechanical Output Power (in W)
= 0.25 x (Stall Torque in N-m) x (No Load Speed in rad/s). [[This
calculator from the *FIRST* Tech Challenge
documentation]{.underline}](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/tech_tips/tech-tips.html#powercalculator)
can be used to help calculate output power from inputs of various units.

Given the extensive amount of motors allowed on the ROBOT, teams are
encouraged to consider the total power available from the ROBOT battery
during the design and build of the ROBOT. Drawing large amounts of
current from many motors at the same time could lead to drops in ROBOT
battery voltage that may result in tripping the main breaker or trigger
the brownout protection of the roboRIO. For more information about the
roboRIO brownout protection and measuring current draw using the
PDP/PDH, see [[roboRIO Brownout and Understanding Current
Draw]{.underline}](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/roborio-info/roborio-brownouts.html).

AndyMark PG Gearmotors are sold with labeling based on the entire
assembly. Assemblies labeled am-3651 through am-3656 contain legal
motors specified in [Table 8‑1]{.underline}. These motors may be used
with or without the provided gearbox.

127. **\*Only 4 propulsion motors.** A ROBOT may not have more than 4
     propulsion motors. A propulsion motor is a motor that enables the
     ROBOT to move around the FIELD surface. Motors that generate small
     amounts of thrust as a secondary or incidental feature are not
     considered propulsion motors.

Examples that are not considered propulsion motors include:

A.  motors that primarily alter the alignment of a wheel in contact with
    the FIELD surface (such as a swerve steering motor),

<!-- -->

M.  motors that run MECHANISM wheels (e.g. for SCORING ELEMENT
    manipulation) that occasionally happen to contact the carpet, but
    without enough force to generate significant thrust, and

N.  motors that change the speed of the drive wheels using a shifting
    MECHANISM without significantly contributing to propulsion.

<!-- -->

128. **\*Don't modify motors (mostly).** The integral mechanical and
     electrical system of any motor must not be modified. Motors,
     servos, and electric solenoids used on the ROBOT shall not be
     modified in any way, except as follows:

<!-- -->

A.  The mounting brackets and/or output shaft/interface may be modified
    to facilitate the physical connection of the motor to the ROBOT and
    actuated part.

<!-- -->

R.  The electrical leads may be trimmed to length as necessary and
    connectors or splices to additional wiring may be added.

S.  The locking pins on the window motors (P/N 262100-3030 and
    262100-3040) may be removed.

T.  The connector housings on KOP automotive motors listed in [Table
    8‑1]{.underline} may be modified to facilitate lead connections.

U.  Servos may be modified as specified by the manufacturer (e.g.
    re-programming or modification for continuous rotation).

V.  Minimal labeling may be applied to indicate device purpose,
    connectivity, functional performance, etc.

W.  Any number of #10-32 plug screws may be removed from the Falcon 500
    and the Kraken X60.

X.  Insulation may be applied to electrical terminals.

Y.  Repairs, provided the original performance and specifications are
    unchanged.

Z.  Maintenance recommended by the manufacturer.

The intent of this rule is to allow teams to modify mounting tabs and
the like, not to gain a weight reduction by potentially compromising the
structural integrity of any motor.

129. **\*Power (most) actuators off of approved devices.** With the
     exception of servos, fans, or motors integral to sensors of COTS
     computing devices permitted in [R501]{.underline}, each actuator
     must be controlled by a power regulating device. The only power
     regulating devices for actuators permitted on the ROBOT include:

<!-- -->

A.  motor controllers:

    a.  Koors40 Motor Controller (P/N am-5600),

    b.  Spark Flex Motor Controller (P/N REV-11-2159, am-5276)

    c.  Spark Motor Controller (P/N REV-11-1200, am-4260),

Note: The Automation Direct Relays are single directional. Per
[R504]{.underline} they may not be wired together in an attempt to
provide bi-directional control.

130. **\*Don't overload controllers.** Each power regulating device may
     control electrical loads per [Table 8‑2]{.underline}. Unless
     otherwise noted, each power regulating device shall control 1 and
     only 1 electrical load.

: Power regulating device allotments

131. **\*Control servos safely.** Servos must be connected to, and only
     to, 1 of the following:

<!-- -->

A.  PWM ports on the roboRIO,

<!-- -->

A.  PWM ports on a WCP Spartan Sensor Board (P/N WCP-0045),

B.  REV Robotics Servo Power Module (P/N REV-11-1144), or

C.  REV Robotics Servo Hub (P/N REV-11-1855).

## Power Distribution

In order to maintain safety, the rules in this section apply at all
times while at the event, not just while the ROBOT is on the FIELD for
MATCHES.

601. **\*Battery limit -- everyone has the same power.** The only legal
     source of electrical energy for the ROBOT during the competition,
     the ROBOT battery, must be 1 and only 1 non-spillable sealed lead
     acid (SLA) battery with the following specifications:

<!-- -->

A.  Nominal voltage: 12V

<!-- -->

D.  Nominal capacity at 20-hour discharge rate: minimum 17Ah, maximum
    18.2Ah

E.  Shape: Rectangular

F.  Nominal Dimensions: 7.1in x 3.0in x 6.6in, +/- 0.1in for each
    dimension (18.03cm x 7.62cm x 16.76cm, +/-0.25cm for each dimension)

G.  Nominal weight: 11.0lb to 14.5lb (4.99kg to 6.57kg)

H.  Terminals: Nut and bolt style

I.  Battery vents must not be obstructed.

\"Nut and bolt style\" refers to any style battery terminal where the
connector is secured to the battery using a threaded fastener.

Teams should be aware that they may be asked to provide documentation of
the specifications of any battery not listed above.

Batteries should be charged in accordance with manufacturer's
specification. (Please see the [[*FIRST* Safety
Manual]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/safety)
for additional information.)

132. **\*Other batteries for cameras or computers only.** COTS USB
     battery packs with a capacity of 100Wh or less (27000mAh at 3.7V)
     with 5V/5A max output or 12V/5A max output using USB-PD per port,
     batteries integral to and part of a COTS computing device or
     self-contained camera (e.g. laptop batteries, GoPro style camera,
     etc.), or batteries used to power CMOS/RTC features may be used to
     power COTS computing devices and any peripheral COTS input or
     output devices connected to the COTS computing device provided they
     are:

<!-- -->

A.  securely fastened to the ROBOT,

<!-- -->

J.  connected only using unmodified COTS cables, and

K.  charged according to manufacturer recommendations.

A COTS computing device is a non-roboRIO device used to process or
collect sensor information (e.g. a "smart flashlight" is not a COTS
computing device).

133. **\*Charge batteries with safe connectors.** Any battery charger
     used to charge a ROBOT battery must have the corresponding Anderson
     SB connector installed.

134. **\*Charge batteries at a safe rate.** Any battery charger used to
     charge a ROBOT battery may not be used such that it exceeds 6-Amp
     average charge current.

135. **\*Batteries are not ballast.** No batteries other than those
     allowed per [R601]{.underline} and [R602]{.underline} are allowed
     on the ROBOT, whether or not they are being used to supply power.

For example, teams may not use additional batteries as extra weight on
their ROBOTS.

136. **\*Secure the battery.** The ROBOT battery must be secured such
     that it will not dislodge during vigorous ROBOT interaction
     including if the ROBOT is turned over or placed in any arbitrary
     orientation.

137. **\*Insulate battery connections.** Each electrical terminal on the
     ROBOT battery, main breaker, and their connections (lugs, stripped
     wire ends, etc.) to the wire must be fully insulated at all times.

138. **\*Limit non-battery energy.** Non-electrical sources of energy
     used by the ROBOT (i.e., stored at the start of a MATCH) shall come
     only from the following sources:

<!-- -->

A.  compressed air stored in the pneumatic system that has been charged
    in compliance with [R806]{.underline} and [R807]{.underline},

<!-- -->

L.  a change in the altitude of the ROBOT center of gravity,

M.  storage achieved by deformation of ROBOT parts,

N.  closed-loop COTS pneumatic (gas) shocks, or

O.  air-filled (pneumatic) wheels.

<!-- -->

139. **\*Connect main power safely.** The following devices shall be
     connected with 6 AWG (7 SWG or 16 mm2) copper wire or larger as
     shown in [Figure 8‑11]{.underline}:

<!-- -->

A.  1 ROBOT battery,

<!-- -->

P.  a single pair of Anderson Power Products (or APP) 2-pole SB type
    connectors,

Q.  a single main 120-Amp (120A) surface mount circuit breaker (Cooper
    Bussman P/N CB185-120, CB185F-120, CB285-120 CB285F-120, CB285120F
    or Optifuse P/N 153120, 253120), and

R.  a single main power distribution device (PD):

    a.  CTR Electronics Power Distribution Panel (PDP) P/N am-2856,
        217-4244, 14-806880,

    b.  CTR Electronics Power Distribution Panel 2.0 (PDP 2.0) P/N

    c.  REV Robotics Power Distribution Hub (PDH) P/N REV-11-1850

    d.  AndyMark Power Distribution (AMPD) P/N am-5754

No additional devices or modifications shall be permitted with the
following exceptions:

S.  Monitoring circuitry permitted by [R625]{.underline},

T.  SB-50 to SB-120 adapters, provided they have been presented for
    Inspection,

U.  Termination of wires with appropriate cable lugs, and/or

</figure>

"SB type" refers to SB type only (e.g. SB-50, SB-120, etc.), not SBS or
any other part type beginning with SB. All batteries supplied by *FIRST*
(such as Spare Parts and international batteries) will have a red or
pink SB50 connector installed which may not be removed.

The pink connectors included in the KOP mate with the red SB50
connector.

While pure copper wire is recommended, copper-clad aluminum wire is
considered copper wire

140. **\*1 breaker/fuse per circuit.** All circuits, with the exceptions
     of those listed in [R615]{.underline} and [R617]{.underline}, must
     connect to, and have power sourced solely by, a single protected
     connector pair of the PD. Circuits must not connect to the main
     power input of the PD.

141. **\*The ROBOT frame is not a wire.** All wiring and electrical
     devices shall be electrically isolated from the ROBOT frame. The
     ROBOT frame must not be used to carry electrical current.

Compliance with this rule is checked by observing a \>120Ω resistance
between either the (+) or (-) post within the APP connector that is
attached to the PD and any point on the ROBOT.

All legal motor controllers with metal cases are electrically isolated.
They may be mounted directly to ROBOT frame COMPONENTS.

Note that some cameras, decorative lights, and sensors (e.g. some
encoders, some IR sensors, etc.) have grounded enclosures or are
manufactured with conductive plastics. These devices must be
electrically isolated from the ROBOT frame to ensure compliance with
this rule.

142. **\*Must be able to turn ROBOT on and off safely.** The 120A
     circuit breaker must be quickly and safely accessible from the
     exterior of the ROBOT. This is the only 120A circuit breaker
     allowed on the ROBOT.

Examples considered not "quickly and safely accessible" include breakers
covered by an access panel or door, or mounted on, underneath or
immediately adjacent to moving COMPONENTS.

It is strongly recommended that the 120A circuit breaker location be
clearly and obviously labeled so it can be easily found by FIELD STAFF
if needed.

While the main breaker must be accessible, consider positioning or
shielding it such that it's protected from accidental actuation (e.g.
it's unlikely to be hit by a SCORING ELEMENT during game play).

143. **\*Electrical system must be inspectable.** The PD, associated
     wiring, and all circuit breakers must be visible for inspection.

"Visible for inspection" does not require that the items be visible when
the ROBOT is in STARTING CONFIGURATION, provided the team can make the
items viewable during the inspection process.

144. **\*No high voltage allowed.** Any active electrical item that is
     not an actuator (specified in [R501]{.underline}) or core control
     system item (specified in [R710]{.underline}) is considered a
     CUSTOM CIRCUIT. CUSTOM CIRCUITS shall not produce measurable
     voltages exceeding 24V with the exception of COTS
     Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) injector devices used with COTS Ethernet
     cables and COTS receiving devices (i.e. not a breakout or adapter).

145. **\*Power roboRIO as specified.** The roboRIO power input must be
     connected directly to a non-switched pair of protected output
     terminals of a PD with a 10A fuse or circuit breaker installed.

146. **\*Power radio as specified -- Part 1.** The wireless bridge
     (radio) power must be connected based on the radio type:

<!-- -->

A.  For VH-109 radios, radio power must be sourced from one or both of:

    a.  Injected into the "RIO" port of the radio using a passive
        injector or modified Ethernet cable connected directly to a PD,
        and/or

    b.  Wired directly to the 12V power input of the radio from a PD.

B.  For OM5P radios (China events only), radio power must be sourced
    from only one of:

    a.  the 12V/2A output of a CTR Electronics Voltage Regulator Module
        (VRM) (P/N am-2857, 217-4245), as shown in [Figure
        8‑12]{.underline}, and must be the only load connected to any of
        the 12V/2A terminals or

> Radio power source from a VRM

a.  using an Ethernet cable between a REV Radio Power Module (RPM) (P/N
    REV-11-1856) and the "18-24v PoE" port.

> Note that this prohibits using any other active PoE injector device to
> power the radio but does not prohibit using any PASSIVE CONDUCTORS to
> inject the VRM power into an Ethernet cable plugged into the OM5P
> radio port labeled "18-24v PoE."
>
> Please reference [[How to Wire an FRC
> Robot]{.underline}](https://frc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/how-to-wire-a-robot.html)
> for wireless bridge wiring information.

147. **\*Power radio as specified -- Part 2.** The device supplying
     power to the wireless bridge per [R616]{.underline} must be
     connected directly to a non-switched pair of protected output
     terminals of a PD with a 10A fuse or circuit breaker installed with
     the exception of the PDP 1.0 shared VRM/PCM pairs which may be
     protected with a 20A fuse or circuit breaker.

148. **\*Use PD terminals as designed.** Only 1 wire shall be connected
     to each terminal on the PD.

If multi-point distribution of circuit power is needed (e.g. to provide
power to multiple PCMs and/or VRMs from a single 20A circuit), then all
incoming wires may be appropriately spliced into the main lead (e.g.
using an insulated terminal block, crimped splice or soldered wire
splice), and the single main lead inserted into the terminal to power
the circuit.

149. **\*Only use specified circuit breakers in a PD.** The only circuit
     breakers permitted for use in the PD are:

<!-- -->

A.  Snap Action VB3-A Series or AT2-A, terminal style F57, 40A rating or
    lower,

<!-- -->

V.  Snap Action MX5-A or MX5-L Series, 40A rating or lower,

W.  REV Robotics ATO auto-resetting breakers 40A rating or lower,

X.  CTR Electronics ATO auto-resetting breakers 40A rating or lower, and

Y.  Any ATM circuit breaker with value less than or equal to the fuses
    permitted per [R620]{.underline}.

<!-- -->

150. **\*Only use specified fuses in PD.** The only fuses permitted for
     use in the PD are automotive blade fuses with the following values:

<!-- -->

A.  for the PDP, ATM style fuses with values matching the value printed
    on the device's corresponding fuse holder,

<!-- -->

Z.  for all PDs ATC/ATO style fuses with values 10A or lower, and

A.  for the PDH, ATM style fuses with values 15A or lower with the
    exception of a single 20A fuse for powering a PCM or PH.

Note that these fuses must be pressed very firmly to seat properly.
Improper seating can cause a device to reboot upon impact.

151. **\*Protect circuits with appropriate circuit breakers.** Each
     branch circuit must be protected by 1 and only 1 circuit breaker or
     fuse on the PD per [Table 8‑3]{.underline}. No other electrical
     load can be connected to the breaker or fuse supplying this circuit
     with the exception of devices downstream of a permitted motor power
     adapter board placed between the PD and a motor controller
     (WCP-1380, RF-4003, RF-4004, RF-4005).

  : Branch circuit protection requirements

This rule does not prohibit the use of smaller value breakers in the PD
or any fuses or breakers within CUSTOM CIRCUITS for additional
protection.

Fans permitted per [R501]{.underline} may also be included within CUSTOM
CIRCUITS.

152. **\*Use appropriately sized wire.** All circuits shall be wired
     with appropriately sized insulated copper wire (SIGNAL LEVEL cables
     don't have to be copper):

: Breaker and wire sizing

Wires that are recommended by the device manufacturer or originally
attached to legal devices are considered part of the device and by
default legal. Such wires are exempt from this rule, provided they are
powered by the smallest value fuse or breaker which permits proper
device operation.

In order to show compliance with these rules, teams should use wire with
clearly labeled sizes if possible. If unlabeled wiring is used, teams
should be prepared to demonstrate that the wire used meets the
requirements of this rule (e.g. wire samples and evidence that they are
the required size).

While pure copper wire is recommended, copper-clad aluminum wire is
considered copper wire.

153. **\*Use only appropriate connectors.** Branch circuits may include
     intermediate elements such as COTS connectors, splices, COTS
     flexible/rolling/sliding contacts, and COTS slip rings, as long as
     the entire electrical pathway is via appropriately gauged/rated
     elements.

Slip rings containing mercury are prohibited per [R203]{.underline}.

154. **\*Use specified wire colors (mostly).** All non-SIGNAL LEVEL
     wiring with a constant polarity (i.e., except for outputs of relay
     modules, motor controllers, or sensors) shall be color-coded along
     their entire length from the manufacturer as follows:

<!-- -->

A.  red, yellow, white, brown, or black-with-stripe on the positive
    (e.g. +24VDC, +12VDC, +5VDC, etc.) connections,

<!-- -->

B.  black or blue for the common or negative side (-) of the connections

Exceptions to this rule include:

C.  wires that are originally attached to legal devices and any
    extensions to these wires using the same color as the manufacturer,

D.  Ethernet cable used in PoE cables.

<!-- -->

155. **\*Don't modify critical power paths.** CUSTOM CIRCUITS shall not
     directly alter the power pathways between the ROBOT battery, PD,
     motor controllers, relays (per [R504-B]{.underline}), motors and
     actuators (per [[R501]{.underline}](#R501)), pneumatic solenoid
     valves, or other elements of the ROBOT control system (items
     explicitly mentioned in [R710]{.underline}). Custom high impedance
     voltage monitoring or low impedance current monitoring circuitry
     connected to the ROBOT'S electrical system is acceptable, if the
     effect on the ROBOT outputs is inconsequential.

A noise filter may be wired across motor leads or PWM leads. Such
filters will not be considered CUSTOM CIRCUITS and violate neither this
rule nor [R712]{.underline}.

Acceptable signal filters must be fully insulated and must be 1 of the
following:

- 1 microfarad (1 µF) or less, non-polarized, capacitor may be applied
  across the power leads of any motor on your ROBOT (as close to the
  actual motor leads as reasonably possible) or

- a resistor may be used as a shunt load for the PWM control signal
  feeding a servo.

156. []{#R626 .anchor}**\*VH-109 PoE passthrough.** The VH-109 PoE
     output may be used only under the following conditions:

<!-- -->

A.  The device being powered is a COTS device or COTS adapter connected
    to a single COTS device with current draw ≤ 2A at 12V.

<!-- -->

E.  The connection is made using standard Cat5e/6/7/8 cable.

F.  The VH-109 is powered using the 12V input terminals with 18AWG wire
    or larger (it may additionally be powered using the PoE input if
    desired).

## Control, Command & Signals System

701. **\*Control the ROBOT with a roboRIO.** ROBOTS must be controlled
     via 1 programmable NI roboRIO or roboRIO 2.0 (P/N am3000 or
     am3000a, both versions referred to throughout this manual as
     "roboRIO"), with image version 2026_v1.2 or later.

There are no rules that prohibit co-processors, provided commands
originate from the roboRIO to enable and disable all power regulating
devices. This includes motor controllers legally wired to the CAN bus.

157. **\*Communicate with the ROBOT with the specified radio.** 1 Vivid
     Hosting wireless bridge (P/N: VH-109, WCP-1538), that has been
     configured with the appropriate encryption key for your team number
     at each event, is the only permitted device for communicating to
     and from the ROBOT during the MATCH. Events held in China are the
     exceptions to this rule and must use an OpenMesh (P/N: OM5P-AN or
     OM5P-AC) radio.

158. **\*Use specific Ethernet port for roboRIO.** The roboRIO Ethernet
     port must be connected as specified:

<!-- -->

A.  For VH-109 v1.5 radios: to the port labeled "RIO" either directly,
    via a Cat5 Ethernet pigtail, or via a passive PoE injector cable or
    adapter.

<!-- -->

G.  For VH-109 v1.0 radios (either directly or via Cat5 Ethernet
    pigtail):

    a.  to the radio port labeled "RIO" via a passive PoE injector cable
        or adapter (whether or not it is used to power the radio), or an
        Ethernet cable with the appropriate wires removed on the roboRIO
        end. All wires or adapters used must be fully insulated, or

    b.  to the radio port labeled "AUX 1" or "AUX 2" with the
        corresponding DIP switch in the off (default) position.

H.  For OM5P radios (China events only): to the wireless bridge port
    labeled "18-24v PoE" (either directly, via a network switch, via an
    RPM, or via a Cat5 Ethernet pigtail).

Note: Placing a switch between the roboRIO and radio may impede the
ability for FIELD STAFF to troubleshoot roboRIO connection issues on the
FIELD. Teams may be asked to connect directly between the radio and the
roboRIO as part of troubleshooting efforts.

If not using the "RIO" port of the VH-109 1.0, it is strongly
recommended to cover the port to prevent accidental damage to devices
such as laptops which may occur if attached to this port.

159. **\*Only use allowed ports and bandwidth to communicate with the
     ROBOT.** Communication between the ROBOT and the OPERATOR CONSOLE
     may not exceed the following and is restricted to network ports
     listed in [Table 8‑5]{.underline}:

<!-- -->

A.  7.0Mbits/second for Vivid Hosting wireless bridge radios

<!-- -->

I.  4.0Mbits/second for OpenMesh radios

  : Open FMS ports

Teams may use these ports as they wish if they do not employ them as
outlined above (i.e. TCP 1180 can be used to pass data back and forth
between the ROBOT and the Driver Station Software if the team chooses
not to use the camera on USB).

Note that the 4.0Mbit limit will be strictly enforced by the wireless
bridge.

The [[FMS
Whitepaper]{.underline}](https://fms-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fms-whitepaper/fms-whitepaper.html)
has more details on how to check and optimize bandwidth usage.

While *FIRST* makes every effort to provide a wireless environment that
allows teams access to a full 4.0Mbits/second data rate (with about
100.0Kbit used for ROBOT control and status), at some events wireless
conditions may not accommodate this.

160. **\*Configure devices for your team number.** The roboRIO, Driver
     Station Software, and wireless bridge must be configured to
     correspond to the correct team number, per the procedures defined
     in the [[*FIRST* Robotics Competition Control System
     documentation]{.underline}](https://frc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

161. **\*Don't bypass the ARENA network.** All signals must originate
     from the OPERATOR CONSOLE and be transmitted to the ROBOT via the
     ARENA Ethernet network.

162. **\*Limited wireless allowed.** The only forms of wireless
     communication that may be used to communicate to, from, or within
     the ROBOT, include:

<!-- -->

A.  those required per [R702]{.underline} and [R706]{.underline},

B.  tags used for location detection systems if provided by the event,
    and

C.  RFID or NFC systems used exclusively within the ROBOT.

Devices that employ signals in the visual spectrum (e.g. cameras) and
non-RF sensors that don't receive human-originated commands (e.g. "beam
break" sensors or IR sensors on the ROBOT used to detect FIELD elements)
are not wireless communication devices and thus this rule doesn't apply.

163. **\*Wireless bridge must be visible.** The wireless bridge must be
     mounted on the ROBOT such that the diagnostic lights are visible to
     FIELD STAFF.

Teams are encouraged to mount the wireless bridge away from noise
generating devices such as motors, PCM(s)/PH(s), and VRM(s)/RPM(s).

164. **\*ROBOTS must have a signal light.** ROBOTS must use at least 1,
     but no more than 2, diagnostic ROBOT Signal Light (RSL) (P/N
     855PB-B12ME522 and/or am-3583).

Any RSL must be:

A.  mounted on the ROBOT such that it is easily visible while standing
    36.0in (91.44cm) away from at least one side of the ROBOT,

B.  connected to the "RSL" supply terminals on the roboRIO, and

C.  if using the 855PB-B12ME522, wired for solid light operation, by
    placing a jumper between the "La" and "Lb" terminals on the light
    per [Figure 8‑13]{.underline}.

Please see [[How to Wire an FRC
ROBOT]{.underline}](https://frc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/how-to-wire-a-robot.html)

165. **\*Only specified modifications to control system devices
     permitted.** The Driver Station Software, roboRIO, PD,
     PCM(s)/PH(s), VRM(s)/RPM(s), RSL, 120A breaker, motor controllers,
     MXP devices used to control actuators per [R713-C]{.underline},
     relay modules (per [R504-B]{.underline}), wireless bridge, PD
     breakers and fuses, Servo Power Module, Servo Hub, motor power
     adapter boards, and batteries shall not be tampered with, modified,
     or adjusted in any way (tampering includes drilling, cutting,
     machining, rewiring, disassembling, painting, etc.), with the
     following exceptions:

Please note that the Driver Station Software is a separate application
from the Dashboard. The Driver Station Software may not be modified,
while teams are expected to customize their Dashboard code.

A.  User programmable code in the roboRIO may be customized.

<!-- -->

J.  Motor controllers may be calibrated as described in owner\'s
    manuals.

K.  Fans may be attached to motor controllers and may be powered from
    the power input terminals.

L.  If powering the compressor, the fuse on a Spike H-Bridge Relay may
    be replaced with a VB3A-20A Snap-Action circuit breaker.

M.  Wires, cables, and signal lines may be connected via the standard
    connection points provided on the devices.

N.  Fasteners (including adhesives) may be used to attach the device to
    the OPERATOR CONSOLE or ROBOT or to secure cables to the device.

O.  Thermal interface material may be used to improve heat conduction.

P.  Labeling may be applied to indicate device purpose, connectivity,
    functional performance, etc.

Q.  Jumpers may be changed from their default location.

R.  Limit switch jumpers may be removed from a Jaguar motor controller
    and a custom limit switch circuit may be substituted.

S.  Device firmware may be updated with manufacturer supplied firmware.

T.  Integral wires on motor controllers may be cut, stripped, and/or
    connectorized.

U.  Devices may be repaired, provided the performance and specifications
    of the device after the repair are identical to those before the
    repair.

V.  The cover may be removed from the Talon SRX or Talon FX data port.

W.  Electrical tape may be applied to the aluminum plate inside the
    wireless bridge.

X.  The input terminal cover from the PDP may be omitted (no other
    element may be installed using the threaded holes to install
    something in place of the PDP terminal cover).

Y.  The roboRIO 2.0 SD card may be replaced with an SD card of any
    capacity.

Z.  adding insulating material to exposed conductors.

A.  replacing control system power terminal blocks (e.g. RSL power
    connector) with functional equivalents.

B.  tape may be applied for debris protection.

C.  VH-109 v1.0 may be upgraded to VH-109 v1.5 using manufacturer
    materials and instructions.

Please note that while repairs are permitted, the allowance is
independent of any manufacturer's warranty. Teams make repairs at their
own risk and should assume that any warranty or return options are
forfeited. Be aware that diagnosing and repairing COMPONENTS such as
these can be difficult.

For more information about modification O, please see [[this OM5P-AC
Radio Modification
article]{.underline}](https://frc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/networking/networking-introduction/om5p-ac-radio-modification.html).

166. **\*Don't connect motor outputs to roboRIO.** Neither 12VDC power
     nor relay module or motor controller outputs shall be directly
     connected to the roboRIO, with the exception of the designated
     12VDC input.

167. **\*Control PWM controllers from the roboRIO.** Every relay module
     (per [R504-B]{.underline}), servo, Servo Power Module, and PWM
     motor controller shall be connected to a corresponding port (relays
     to Relay ports, servos, and PWM controllers to PWM ports) on the
     roboRIO (either directly or through a WCP Spartan Sensor Board) or
     via a legal MXP connection (per [R713]{.underline}). They shall not
     be controlled by signals from any other source.

168. **\*Only approved MXP devices can control actuators.** If a motor
     is controlled via the MXP, its power regulating device must be
     connected by 1 of the following methods:

<!-- -->

A.  directly to any PWM pins,

<!-- -->

D.  via a network of PASSIVE CONDUCTORS used to extend the PWM pins, or

E.  via 1 approved ACTIVE DEVICE:

    a.  Kauai Labs navX MXP

    b.  Kauai Labs navX2 MXP

    c.  RCAL MXP Daughterboard

    d.  REV Robotics RIOduino

    e.  REV Robotics Digit Board

    f.  West Coast Products Spartan Sensor Board

    g.  Huskie Robotics HUSKIE 2.0 Board

A PASSIVE CONDUCTOR is any device or circuit whose capability is limited
to the conduction and/or static regulation of the electrical energy
applied to it (e.g. wire, splices, connectors, printed wiring board,
etc.).

An ACTIVE DEVICE is any device capable of dynamically controlling and/or
converting a source of electrical energy by the application of external
electrical stimulus.

The "network of PASSIVE CONDUCTORS" only applies to the pins being used
for PWM output to motors or servos. This means that connecting an ACTIVE
DEVICE, such as a sensor to 1 MXP pin does not prevent other MXP pins
from being used in accordance with B.

169. **\*Control CAN motor controllers from the roboRIO.** Each CAN
     motor controller must be controlled with enable/disable inputs
     sourced from the roboRIO and passed via either a PWM (wired per
     [R713]{.underline}) or CAN bus (either directly or daisy-chained
     via another CAN bus device) signal, but both shall not be wired
     simultaneously on the same device.

As long as the CAN bus is wired legally so that the heartbeat from the
roboRIO is maintained, all closed loop control features of the CAN motor
controller may be used. (That is, commands originating from the roboRIO
to configure, enable, and specify an operating point for all CAN motor
controller closed loop modes fit the intent of [R701]{.underline}).

"Wired directly" includes via any series of PASSIVE CONDUCTORS (i.e.
star or hub configurations using only PASSIVE CONDUCTORS are permitted.)

170. **\*Control PCM, PH, and Servo Hub from roboRIO.** Each Pneumatic
     Control Module (PCM), Pneumatic Hub (PH), and Servo Hub must be
     controlled with signal inputs sourced from the roboRIO and passed
     via a CAN bus connection from the built-in CAN on the roboRIO
     (either directly or daisy-chained via another CAN bus device).

171. **\*Don't alter the CAN bus.** No device that interferes with,
     alters, or blocks communications among the roboRIO and the
     PCMs/PHs, and/or CAN motor controllers on the bus will be
     permitted.

Only 1 wire should be inserted into each Weidmuller CAN connector
terminal. For documentation on how to wire the CAN bus connections see
[[How to Wire an FRC
ROBOT]{.underline}](https://frc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/how-to-wire-a-robot.html).

172. **\*USB to CAN adapter permitted.** Additional CAN bus connections
     may be added to the roboRIO using the CTR Electronics CANivore^TM^
     (P/N 21-678682, WCP-1522) USB-to-CAN adapter.

Any additional CAN bus added in this manner satisfies the requirements
of [R714]{.underline} (i.e. you may connect motor controllers to this
additional bus).

## Pneumatic System

In order to maintain safety, the rules in this section apply at all
times while at the event, not just while the ROBOT is on the FIELD for
MATCHES.

801. **\*Only use explicitly permitted pneumatic parts**. To satisfy
     multiple constraints associated with safety, consistency,
     inspection, and constructive innovation, no pneumatic parts other
     than those explicitly permitted in this section shall be used on
     the ROBOT.

<!-- -->

173. **\*No custom pneumatics and meet minimum pressure ratings.** All
     pneumatic items must be COTS pneumatic devices and either:

<!-- -->

A.  rated by their manufacturers for pressure of at least 125.0psi
    (861.8kPa, 8.618Bar), or

<!-- -->

F.  installed downstream of the primary relieving regulator (see
    [R809]{.underline}), and rated for pressure of at least 70.0psi
    (482.6kPa, 4.826Bar).

Any pressure specification such as "working," "operating," "maximum,"
etc. may be used to satisfy the requirements of this rule.

It is recommended that all pneumatic items be rated by their
manufacturers for a working pressure of at least 60.0psi (413.7kPa,
4.137Bar).

174. **\*Don't modify pneumatics.** All pneumatic COMPONENTS must be
     used in their original, unaltered condition. Exceptions are as
     follows:

<!-- -->

A.  tubing may be cut,

B.  wiring for pneumatic devices may be modified to interface with the
    control system,

C.  assembling and connecting pneumatic COMPONENTS using the
    pre-existing threads, mounting brackets, quick-connect fittings,
    etc.,

D.  removing the mounting pin from a pneumatic cylinder, provided the
    cylinder itself is not modified, and

E.  labeling applied to indicate device purpose, connectivity,
    functional performance, etc.

Do not, for example, paint, file, machine, or abrasively remove any part
of a pneumatic COMPONENT -- this would cause the part to become a
prohibited item.

175. **\*Only use specific pneumatic devices.** The only pneumatic
     system items permitted on ROBOTS include the following items:

<!-- -->

A.  pneumatic pressure vent plug valves functionally equivalent to those
    provided in the KOP,

Examples of acceptable valves include Parker PV609-2 or MV709-2.

G.  pressure relief valves functionally equivalent to those provided in
    the KOP,

Examples of acceptable valves include Norgren 16-004-011, 16-004-003 or
McMaster-Carr 48435K714.

To be considered functionally equivalent the valve must be preset or
adjustable to 125.0psi (861.8kPa, 8.618Bar) and capable of relieving at
least 1.0scfm (471.9cm^3^/s).

H.  solenoid valves with a maximum ⅛in (nominal, 0.31cm) NPT, BSPP, or
    BSPT port diameter or integrated quick connect ¼in (nominal, 0.64cm)
    outside diameter tubing connection,

I.  additional pneumatic tubing, with a maximum ¼in (nominal, 0.64cm)
    outside diameter,

J.  pressure transducers, pressure gauges, passive flow control valves
    (specifically "needle valve"), manifolds, and connecting fittings
    (including COTS pneumatic U-tubes),

K.  check and quick exhaust valves, provided that the requirements of
    [R813]{.underline} are still met,

L.  shutoff valves which relieve downstream pressure to atmosphere when
    closed (may also be known as 3-way or 3-way exhausting valves),

M.  pressure regulators with the maximum outlet pressure adjusted to no
    more than 60.0psi (413.7kPa, 4.137Bar),

N.  pneumatic cylinders, pneumatic linear actuators, and rotary
    actuators,

O.  pneumatic storage tanks (with the exception of white Clippard tanks
    P/N AVT-PP-41),

P.  1 compressor that is compliant with [R806]{.underline},

Q.  debris or coalescing (water) filters, and

R.  Venturi valves (note: the high-pressure side of a Venturi valve is
    considered a pneumatic device and must follow all pneumatic rules.
    The vacuum side of a Venturi valve is exempt from the pneumatic
    rules per "a" in the blue box below).

The following devices are not considered pneumatic devices and are not
subject to pneumatic rules (though they must satisfy all other rules):

A.  a device that creates a vacuum,

<!-- -->

Z.  closed-loop COTS pneumatic (gas) shocks,

A.  air-filled (pneumatic) wheels, and

B.  pneumatic devices not used as part of a pneumatic system (i.e. used
    in a way that does not allow them to contain pressurized air)

<!-- -->

176. **\*If using pneumatics, these parts are required.** If pneumatic
     COMPONENTS are used, the following items are required as part of
     the pneumatic circuit and must be used in accordance with this
     section, as illustrated in [Figure 8‑14]{.underline}.

<!-- -->

A.  1 *FIRST* Robotics Competition legal compressor (per
    [R806]{.underline}),

<!-- -->

S.  a pressure relief valve (per [R804-B]{.underline}) connected and
    calibrated (per [R811]{.underline}),

T.  a Nason pressure switch (P/N SM-2B-115R/443) and/or REV Robotics
    Analog Pressure Sensor (P/N REV-11-1107) connected and wired per
    [R812]{.underline},

U.  at least 1 pressure vent plug plumbed (per [R813]{.underline}),

V.  stored pressure gauge and working pressure gauge (per
    [R810]{.underline}), and

W.  1 primary working pressure regulator (per [R808]{.underline}).

style="width:4.4119in;height:3.35849in"
alt="Figure showing pneumatic circuitry. " />
<figcaption><p>Pneumatic circuitry</p></figcaption>
</figure>

177. **\*Compressed air from ROBOT compressor only.** Throughout an
     event, compressed air on the ROBOT must be provided by its 1
     onboard compressor only. Compressor specifications must not exceed
     nominal 1.1cfm (519.1cm^3^/s) flow rate @ 12VDC at any pressure.

A ROBOT'S compressor may be substituted by another compressor, but a
ROBOT may only have 1 designated compressor at a time, and all
compressed air on the ROBOT must be sourced from a single compressor.

Note: Viair C-series compressors, which have a max working pressure of
120.0psi, are rated for intermittent pressures greater than 125.0psi and
therefore meet the requirements of this rule.

178. **\*Air storage pressure limit.** Stored air pressure on the ROBOT
     must be no greater than 120.0psi (\~827 kPa, 8.2 Bar). No stored
     air pressure intended for the ROBOT may be located off-board the
     ROBOT.

179. **\*Working air pressure limit.** Working air pressure (air
     pressure used to actuate devices) on the ROBOT must be no greater
     than 60.0psi (413.7kPa, 4.137Bar) and must be provided through a
     single primary adjustable, relieving, pressure regulator.
     Additional regulators may be located downstream of the single
     primary regulator.

Examples of acceptable valves include Norgren regulator P/N R07-100-RNEA
and Monnier P/N 101-3002-1.

180. **\*Limited devices at high pressure.** Only the compressor, relief
     valve, pressure switch, pressure vent plug, pressure gauge, storage
     tanks, tubing, pressure transducers, filters, and connecting
     fittings may be in the high-pressure pneumatic circuit upstream
     from the regulator.

It is recommended that all COMPONENTS in the high-pressure pneumatic
circuit upstream from the regulator be rated for at least 115.0psi
(792.9kPa, 7.929Bar) working pressure.

181. **\*Pressure gauges must be visible.** Pressure gauges must be
     placed in easily visible locations upstream and downstream of the
     regulator to display the stored and working pressures,
     respectively. Pressure gauges must show pressure in psi, kPa, or
     Bar.

182. **\*Relief valve requirements.** The relief valve must be attached
     directly to the compressor or attached by legal hard fittings (e.g.
     brass, nylon, etc.) connected to the compressor output port.

Teams are required to check and/or adjust the relief valve to release
air at 125.0psi (861.8kPa, 8.618Bar). The valve may or may not have been
calibrated prior to being supplied to teams.

Instructions for adjusting the pressure relief valve can be found in the
[[Pneumatic
Manual]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/hubfs/web/program/frc/resources/pneumatics-manual.pdf).

183. **\*Pressure switch requirements.** The pressure switch must be
     connected to the high-pressure side of the pneumatic circuit (i.e.
     prior to the pressure regulator) to sense the stored pressure of
     the circuit.

It must be either:

A.  Nason P/N SM-2B-115R/443 (wired as described) and/or

> The 2 wires from the pressure switch must be connected directly to the
> pressure switch input of the PCM/PH controlling the compressor or, if
> controlled using the roboRIO and a relay, to the roboRIO. If connected
> to the roboRIO, the roboRIO must be programmed to sense the state of
> the switch and operate the relay module that powers the compressor to
> prevent over-pressuring the system.

X.  REV Robotics P/N REV-11-1107 (wired as described)

> The analog output of the sensor must be connected directly to analog
> input 0 of the PH (with firmware version 22.0.2 or newer) controlling
> the compressor.

The REV Robotics Analog Pressure Sensor may only be used with PH
compressor control and may not be used with PCM compressor control.

184. **\*Vent plug requirements.** Any pressure vent plug must be:

<!-- -->

A.  connected to the pneumatic circuit such that, when manually
    operated, it will vent to the atmosphere to relieve all stored
    pressure in a reasonable amount of time and

B.  placed on the ROBOT so that it is visible and easily accessible.

<!-- -->

185. **\*Don't connect solenoid outputs together.** The output air from
     multiple solenoid valves must not be combined.

Manifolds, shuttle valves, and other devices which do not combine output
airflow, even though it may be plumbed into the same device, are not
violations of this rule.

## OPERATOR CONSOLE

901. **\*Use the specified Driver Station Software.** The Driver Station
     Software provided by National Instruments ([[install instructions
     found
     here](https://frc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/frc-game-tools.html))]{.underline}
     is the only application permitted to specify and communicate the
     operating mode (i.e. AUTO/TELEOP) and operating state
     (Enable/Disable) to the ROBOT. The Driver Station Software must be
     version 26.0 or newer.

Teams are permitted to use a portable computing device of their choice
(laptop computer, tablet, etc.) to host the Driver Station Software
while participating in MATCHES.

186. **\*The OPERATOR CONSOLE must have a visible display.** The
     OPERATOR CONSOLE, the set of COMPONENTS and MECHANISMS used by the
     DRIVERS and/or HUMAN PLAYERS to relay commands to the ROBOT, must
     include a graphic display to present the Driver Station Software
     diagnostic information. It must be positioned within the OPERATOR
     CONSOLE so that the screen display can be clearly seen during
     inspection and in a MATCH.

187. **\*Connect FMS Ethernet directly to the OPERATOR CONSOLE.**
     Devices hosting the Driver Station Software must only interface
     with the FMS via the Ethernet cable provided at the DRIVER STATION
     (e.g. not through a switch). Teams may connect the FMS Ethernet
     cable to the device running the Driver Station Software directly
     via an Ethernet pigtail, or with a single-port Ethernet converter
     (e.g. docking station, USB-Ethernet converter, Thunderbolt-Ethernet
     converter, etc.). The Ethernet port on the OPERATOR CONSOLE must be
     easily and quickly accessible.

Teams are strongly encouraged to use pigtails on the Ethernet port used
to connect to the FMS. Such pigtails will reduce wear and tear on the
device's port and, with proper strain relief employed, will protect the
port from accidental damage.

188. **\*OPERATOR CONSOLE physical requirements.** The OPERATOR CONSOLE
     must not

<!-- -->

A.  be longer than 60.0in (1.524m),

<!-- -->

Y.  be deeper than 16.0in (40.64cm) (excluding any items that are held
    or worn by the DRIVERS during the MATCH),

Z.  extend more than 78.0in (1.981m) above the floor, or

A.  attach to the FIELD, except via the loop tape as described in
    section [5.9.1 DRIVER STATIONS]{.underline} or clamping to the
    DRIVER STATION support shelf (as long as the shelf is not damaged).

There is a 54.0in (1.372m) long by 2.0in (nominal, 5.08cm) wide strip of
hook-and-loop tape ("loop" side) along the center of the DRIVER STATION
support shelf that should be used to secure the OPERATOR CONSOLE to the
shelf. See section [5.9.1 DRIVER STATIONS]{.underline} for details.

Please note that while there is no hard weight limit, OPERATOR CONSOLES
that weigh more than 30lb (13.61kg) will invite extra scrutiny as they
are likely to present unsafe circumstances.

189. **\*FIELD wireless only.** Other than the system provided by the
     FIELD, no other form of wireless communications shall be used to
     communicate to, from, or within the OPERATOR CONSOLE.

Examples of prohibited wireless systems include, but are not limited to,
active wireless network cards and Bluetooth devices. For the case of the
*FIRST* Robotics Competition, a motion sensing input device (e.g.
Microsoft Kinect) is not considered wireless communication and is
allowed.

190. **\*No unsafe OPERATOR CONSOLES.** OPERATOR CONSOLES shall not be
     made using hazardous materials, be unsafe, cause an unsafe
     condition, or interfere with other DRIVE TEAMS or the operation of
     other ROBOTS.

191. **\*No AC inverters.** OPERATOR CONSOLES must not contain AC
     inverters.

# Inspection & Eligibility (I)

This section describes the rules governing MATCH participation. A team
has participated in a MATCH if any member of their DRIVE TEAM is in the
ALLIANCE AREA, with or without the ROBOT on the FIELD, at the start of
the MATCH.

At each event, the Lead ROBOT INSPECTOR (LRI) has final authority on the
legality of any COMPONENT, MECHANISM, or ROBOT. The LRI may consult with
additional sources including the Global LRIs and/or *FIRST* personnel
before making their final decision. INSPECTORS may re-inspect ROBOTS at
any time to ensure compliance with the rules. Teams are encouraged to
consult with INSPECTORS or the LRI if they have any questions regarding
the legality of a ROBOT or about how to make a ROBOT legal.

The inspection process may progress in blocks, i.e. it may pause for a
team's Practice MATCH, lunch break, etc. The process may employ various
INSPECTORS throughout the process based on availability. At the team's
discretion, they may request a different INSPECTOR or invite the Lead
ROBOT INSPECTOR to participate in their ROBOT'S inspection.

ROBOTS may be modified after completing initial inspection; however,
note that, per [I104]{.underline}, any modifications not specifically
exempt must be re-inspected. Prior to the beginning of Playoff MATCHES,
all ROBOTS wishing to participate will be re-weighed to help identify
any modifications that should be re-inspected per [I104]{.underline}.

ROBOTS are permitted to participate in scheduled Practice MATCHES prior
to passing inspection. However, the FTA, LRI, or Head REFEREE may
determine at any time that the ROBOT is unsafe and may prohibit further
participation in Practice MATCHES until the condition is corrected
and/or the ROBOT passes inspection. A safe ROBOT has functional BUMPERS
that approximately meet the required coverage ([R401]{.underline}),
height ([R402]{.underline}), and cross section ([R408]{.underline})
requirements.

Prior to the start of a MATCH, any ROBOT which is unable or ineligible
to participate in that MATCH, as determined by the FTA, LRI, or Head
REFEREE, is declared to be BYPASSED and is DISABLED. A team whose ROBOT
is BYPASSED remains eligible to receive Qualification Ranking Points or
Playoff MATCH points provided that its ROBOT has passed inspection, per
[I102]{.underline}.

An Inspection Checklist (*coming soon*) is available to help teams
self-inspect their ROBOT before their event. Teams are strongly
encouraged to self-inspect prior to their event.

## Rules

101. **\*It's your team's ROBOT.** The ROBOT and its MAJOR MECHANISMS
     must be built by the *FIRST* Robotics Competition team.

A MAJOR MECHANISM is a group of COMPONENTS and/or MECHANISMS assembled
together to address at least 1 game challenge: ROBOT movement, SCORING
ELEMENT manipulation, FIELD element manipulation, or performance of a
scorable task without the assistance of another ROBOT.

This rule requires that the ROBOT and its MAJOR MECHANISMS were built by
its team, but isn't intended to prohibit or discourage assistance from
other teams (e.g. fabricating elements, supporting construction, writing
software, developing game strategy, contributing COMPONENTS and/or
MECHANISMS, etc.)

Examples of MAJOR MECHANISMS include, but are not limited to, assemblies
used to:

A.  manipulate SCORING ELEMENTS,

<!-- -->

C.  manipulate a FIELD element, and

D.  move the ROBOT around the FIELD.

    Examples that would generally not be considered MAJOR MECHANISMS,
    and thus probably aren't subject to this rule include, but are not
    limited to, the following:

E.  a gearbox assembly,

F.  a COMPONENT or MECHANISM that's part of a MAJOR MECHANISM, and

G.  COTS items.

    Neither this rule nor the language in this blue box define specific
    thresholds for how much of a MAJOR MECHANISM must be the result of
    the team's effort. This rule expects and requires the team's honest
    assessment of whether they built the MAJOR MECHANISMS of their
    ROBOT.

    Attempts to exploit loopholes in the definition of MAJOR MECHANISM
    in order to bypass this requirement are in the spirit of neither
    this rule nor the *FIRST* Robotics Competition. Examples of
    exploitation include:

H.  assembling pieces of a MAJOR MECHANISM provided by another team,
    except COTS kits and

I.  receiving a mostly complete MAJOR MECHANISM from another team and
    providing a small piece.

<!-- -->

102. **\*Get inspected before playing a Qualification MATCH.** A team is
     only permitted to participate in a Qualification or Playoff MATCH
     and receive Ranking or MATCH Points if their ROBOT has passed an
     initial, complete inspection.

Violation: If prior to the start of the MATCH, the team is DISQUALIFIED
and not eligible to participate in the MATCH. If after the MATCH, the
team receives a RED CARD and the MATCH may be replayed per
[T201]{.underline}.

103. **\*Bring it all to inspection.** At the time of inspection, the
     OPERATOR CONSOLE and the ROBOT must be presented with all
     MECHANISMS (including all COMPONENTS of each MECHANISM),
     configurations, and decorations that will be used on the ROBOT in
     MATCHES without re-inspection (per [I104]{.underline}) and may not
     exceed 150.0lb (68.04kg) (note that while up to 150.0lb (68.04kg)
     of ROBOT MECHANISMS may be inspected together, the ROBOT
     configuration used in a MATCH may not violate [R103]{.underline}).
     The OPERATOR CONSOLE and exceptions listed in [R103]{.underline}
     are not included in this weight.

104. **\*Unless the change is listed below, any change to a ROBOT must
     get re-inspected.** A ROBOT may play MATCHES with a subset of the
     MECHANISMS that were present during inspection provided the
     reconfigured ROBOT still complies with all ROBOT Construction
     Rules. Only MECHANISMS that were present during the inspection may
     be added, removed, or reconfigured between MATCHES without
     re-inspection per this rule. If a ROBOT is modified after its most
     recent passed inspection, it must be re-inspected before it is
     eligible to participate in a MATCH.

Exceptions are listed in A through F (unless they result in a
significant change to the ROBOT'S size, weight, legality, or safety).

A.  addition, relocation, or removal of fasteners (e.g. cable ties,
    tape, and rivets),

<!-- -->

B.  addition, relocation, or removal of labeling or marking,

C.  revision of ROBOT code,

D.  replacement of a COTS COMPONENT with an identical COTS COMPONENT,

E.  replacement of a MECHANISM with an identical MECHANISM (size,
    weight, material), and

F.  additions, removals, or reconfiguration of ROBOT with a subset of
    MECHANISMS already inspected per [I103]{.underline}.

<!-- -->

105. **\*Don't exploit re-inspection.** Teams may not use the
     re-inspection process in [I104]{.underline} to circumvent the
     weight limit in [I103]{.underline}.

This restriction is not intended to prevent a team from returning to a
previous configuration (e.g. due to an unsuccessful upgrade or failure
of a new COMPONENT). If a team is believed to be violating this rule,
the LRI will discuss the situation with the team to understand the
changes and, if appropriate, the LRI in conjunction with the team will
select a single configuration with which the team will compete for the
duration of the event.

Example 1: A ROBOT passes initial inspection (which includes MECHANISM
A). Its team then decides they want to use MECHANISM B, which was not
inspected. The weight of the ROBOT, A, and B is less than the weight
limit in [I103]{.underline}, but more than that in [R103]{.underline}.
[I104]{.underline} requires the ROBOT be re-inspected, and this rule
allows the ROBOT, A, and B to be inspected collectively. If passed, the
ROBOT may then compete in subsequent MATCHES with A or B.

Example 2: A ROBOT passes initial inspection (which includes MECHANISM
A). Its team then decides they want to use MECHANISM B, which was not
inspected. The weight of the ROBOT, A, and B is greater than the weight
limit in [I103]{.underline}. This requires re-inspection per
[I104]{.underline} and A is excluded to satisfy [I103]{.underline}. B
breaks, and the team decides to switch back to A. The ROBOT must be
re-inspected per [I104]{.underline}, and the team is not violating this
rule.

Example 3: A team arrives at an event with a ROBOT, MECHANISM A, and
MECHANISM B, which collectively weigh 175.0lb (79.38kg). The ROBOT
passes initial inspection with A and plays a MATCH. The team switches to
B, gets re-inspected, and plays again. The team switches back to A, gets
re-inspected, and plays again. The team switches back to B and asks to
be re-inspected. At this point, the LRI suspects the team may be
violating this rule and has a discussion with the team to understand the
changes being made. The team reveals that this rule has been violated,
and the LRI works with them to select A or B for use for the remainder
of the event.

106. **\*ROBOTS are off for inspection (mostly).** For the safety of all
     those involved, ROBOTS must be presented for inspection with the
     ROBOT powered off, pneumatics unpressurized, and springs or other
     stored energy devices in their lowest potential energy states (e.g.
     battery removed).

Power and air pressure should only be enabled on the ROBOT during those
portions of the inspection process where it is absolutely required to
validate certain system functionality and compliance with specific rules
(firmware check, etc.). INSPECTORS may allow the ROBOT to be powered
beyond the parameters above if both criteria below are met:

A.  the ROBOT design requires power or a charged stored energy device in
    order to confirm that the ROBOT meets volume requirements and

<!-- -->

G.  the team has included safety interlocks that mitigate unexpected
    release of such stored energy.

The team may be asked to demonstrate these interlocks during the
inspection process.

107. **\*No STUDENT, no inspection.** At least 1 STUDENT team member
     must accompany the ROBOT for any inspection efforts.

Exceptions may be made for major conflicts, e.g. religious holidays,
major testing, transportation issues, etc.

# Tournaments (T)

Each 2026 *FIRST* Robotics Competition event is played in a tournament
format. Each tournament consists of 3 types of MATCHES: Practice MATCHES
(not necessarily played at all District Events), Qualification MATCHES,
and Playoff MATCHES.

Practice MATCHES provide each team with an opportunity to operate its
ROBOT on the FIELD prior to the start of the Qualification MATCHES.

Qualification MATCHES allow each team to earn Ranking Points which
determine their seeding position and may qualify them for participation
in the Playoff MATCHES.

Playoff MATCHES determine the event Champions.

## MATCH Schedules

A MATCH schedule is used to coordinate MATCHES at an Event. [Figure
10‑1]{.underline} details information shown on each schedule. SURROGATE
MATCHES are described in section [10.5.2 MATCH Assignment]{.underline}.

<figure>
<img src="./game-manual/media/media/image64.png"
style="width:6.43818in;height:1.98659in"
alt="Figure showing sample Qualification MATCH schedule. " />
<figcaption><p>Sample MATCH schedule</p></figcaption>
</figure>

## MATCH Replays

Over the course of the tournament, it may be necessary for a MATCH to be
replayed. Typical causes for replays are MATCHES that end in a tie
during the Playoffs (due to criteria listed in [Table 10‑3]{.underline}.
or any Finals MATCH), MATCHES that are stopped because FIELD STAFF
anticipated FIELD damage or personal injury, or if there is an ARENA
FAULT.

An ARENA FAULT is an error in ARENA operation that includes, but is not
limited to:

A.  broken FIELD elements due to

    a.  normal, expected game play or

    b.  ROBOT abuse of FIELD elements that affects the outcome of the
        MATCH for their opponents.

A broken FIELD element caused by ROBOT abuse that affects the outcome of
the MATCH for their ALLIANCE is not an ARENA FAULT.

T.  power failure to a portion of the FIELD (tripping the circuit
    breaker in the DRIVER STATION is not considered a power failure),

U.  improper activation by the FMS,

V.  errors by FIELD STAFF (except those listed in section [6.8 Other
    Logistics]{.underline}), and

W.  a ROBOT radio disconnect that impairs operation of other ROBOTS on
    the FIELD for more than 8 seconds.

If, in the judgment of the Head REFEREE, an ARENA FAULT occurs that
affects the outcome of the MATCH and any team on the affected ALLIANCE
desires a replay, the MATCH will be replayed. *FIRST* Headquarters
reserves the right to, with consultation of the Head REFEREE and the
FTA, replay a MATCH in which an ARENA FAULT impacts the outcome of an
event. Once a MATCH replay is granted, a team may not withdraw the
request for the replay.

The outcome of the MATCH is affected if an error occurs that, in the
judgement of the Head REFEREE, changes which ALLIANCE would have won the
MATCH and/or the assignment of Ranking Points.

The outcome of an event is affected if an error occurs that, in the
judgement of *FIRST* Headquarters, changes the assignment of Ranking
Points or has a dramatic effect on points used for ranking criteria.

Note that an ARENA FAULT that does not affect MATCH outcome, in the
judgement of the Head REFEREE, does not lead to a MATCH replay. Examples
include, but are not limited to:

A.  a piece of FIELD plastic falls into the FIELD, far away from any
    human or ROBOT activity, and in such a way that it does not affect
    MATCH outcome,

<!-- -->

J.  delay in the playing of an ARENA sound,

K.  mismatch between the timer on the audience screen and the ARENA
    timer,

L.  any adjustment or delay in assignment of a score or penalty
    (including those made after the MATCH), and

Examples of errors by FIELD STAFF include, but are not limited to:

M.  a gate being left open when the MATCH starts,

N.  mistakenly allowing a ROBOT in violation of [I102]{.underline} that
    hasn't passed an initial, complete inspection to participate in the
    MATCH

<!-- -->

201. **\*Replays will be the same.** All reasonable effort is made to
     create the same conditions when replaying a MATCH caused by an
     ARENA FAULT or FIELD damage. This means, for example, that a team
     that was BYPASSED prior to the start of the MATCH which is to be
     replayed is BYPASSED for the replay MATCH. ROBOT and DRIVE TEAM
     starting locations do not need to be replicated when replaying a
     MATCH.

Violation: MATCH with not start until the situation is corrected

Per section [6.6.1 YELLOW and RED CARDS]{.underline}, cards assigned in
previous MATCHES, including prior instances of the MATCH to be replayed,
are not cleared.

## Measurement

At each event, the ARENA will be open for at least 30 minutes prior to
the start of Qualification MATCHES, during which time teams may survey
and/or measure the ARENA and bring ROBOTS on the FIELD to perform sensor
calibration. Events may schedule additional measurement and calibration
times. The specific time(s) that the FIELD is open will be communicated
to teams at the event. Teams may bring specific questions or comments to
the FTA.

301. **\*Measurement, not practice.** During the period when the ARENA
     is open for measurement:

<!-- -->

A.  ROBOTS can be enabled, but may neither drive, extend outside their
    ROBOT PERIMETER, nor interact with (e.g. score, push, pickup, etc.)
    SCORING ELEMENTS (or anything resembling SCORING ELEMENTS), a HUB,
    BUMP, TRENCH, OUTPOST, or other FIELD elements.

<!-- -->

H.  Humans may touch a SCORING ELEMENT but may not practice with it
    (e.g. throw FUEL, or anything resembling FUEL, or use the OUTPOST).

Violation: VERBAL WARNING, plus YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations at
any point during the event or egregious.

## Practice MATCHES

Practice MATCHES are played before Qualification MATCHES. The Practice
MATCH schedule is available as soon as possible, but no later than the
start of Practice MATCHES. For Regional events, it will also be
published and available online on the [[FRC-Events
website]{.underline}](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/), except
during exceptional circumstances. Practice MATCHES are randomly
assigned, and teams may not switch scheduled Practice MATCHES. Each team
is assigned an equal number of Practice MATCHES unless the number of
teams multiplied by number of Practice MATCHES is not divisible by 6. In
this case, the FMS randomly selects some teams to play an extra Practice
MATCH.

Practice MATCHES are not guaranteed at District Events due to event
schedule constraints.

### Filler Line

A Filler Line is used to fill open slots at events that employ scheduled
Practice MATCHES or all slots at events with an open Practice MATCH
schedule. Teams from the Filler Line are used on a first come, first
served basis to fill empty spots in Practice MATCHES left by other teams
that do not report to Queueing. The number of teams in the Filler Line
is dependent upon space at venues.

Only teams that meet all criteria below qualify for the Filler Line:

A.  ROBOTS in the Filler Line must have passed inspection (this
    requirement may be waived for events with open Practice MATCH
    schedules),

<!-- -->

X.  DRIVE TEAMS must join the Filler Line with their ROBOT,

Y.  teams may not work on their ROBOT while in the Filler Line,

Z.  teams may not occupy more than 1 spot in the Filler Line, and

A.  if a team is queued for their Practice MATCH, they may not also join
    the Filler Line.

## Qualification MATCHES

### Schedule

The Qualification MATCH schedule is made available as soon as possible,
but no later than 30 minutes before Qualification MATCHES are scheduled
to begin. Teams receive 1 hard copy and it is also available on the
[[FRC-Events
website]{.underline}](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/), except
during exceptional circumstances. Each Qualification schedule consists
of a series of rounds in which each team plays 1 MATCH per round.

### MATCH Assignment

FMS assigns each team 2 ALLIANCE partners for each Qualification MATCH
using a predefined algorithm, and teams may not switch Qualification
MATCH assignments. The algorithm employs the following criteria, listed
in order of priority:

1.  ensure each team has at least the minimum required time between
    MATCHES (varies by event size)

2.  minimize the number of times a team is allied with any team

3.  minimize the number of times a team plays opposite any team

4.  minimize the use of SURROGATES (teams randomly assigned by the FMS
    to play an extra Qualification MATCH)

5.  provide even distribution of MATCHES played on blue and red ALLIANCE

6.  provide even distribution of MATCHES played in each DRIVER STATION
    number

For more information about the MATCH scheduling algorithm, please see
[[Idle Loop software's
website]{.underline}](https://idleloop.com/matchmaker/).

At events with fewer than 24 participating teams, the criteria are
similar, except #5 is changed to minimize the number of times a team
swaps between the blue and red ALLIANCE rather than an even
distribution.

All teams are assigned the same number of Qualification MATCHES, equal
to the number of rounds, unless the number of teams multiplied by number
of MATCHES is not divisible by 6. In this case, the FMS randomly selects
some teams to play an extra MATCH. For the purpose of seeding
calculations, those teams are designated as SURROGATES for the extra
MATCH. If a team plays a MATCH as a SURROGATE, it is indicated on the
MATCH schedule, it is always their third Qualification MATCH, and the
outcome of the MATCH has no effect on the team's ranking. YELLOW and RED
CARDS assigned to SURROGATES, however, do carry forward to subsequent
MATCHES.

### Qualification Ranking

Ranking Points are units credited to a team based on their ALLIANCE'S
performance in Qualification MATCHES. Ranking Points are awarded to each
eligible team at the completion of each Qualification MATCH per [Table
6‑4]{.underline}.

Exceptions to Ranking Point assignment are as follows:

A.  A SURROGATE receives 0 Ranking Points.

<!-- -->

B.  A DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE, receives 0
    Ranking Points.

C.  A "no-show" team is either DISQUALIFIED from or issued a RED CARD
    for that MATCH (see [G208]{.underline}). A team is declared a
    no-show if no member of the DRIVE TEAM is in the ALLIANCE AREA at
    the start of the MATCH.

The total number of Ranking Points earned by a team throughout their
Qualification MATCHES divided by the number of MATCHES they've been
scheduled to play (minus any SURROGATE MATCH), then rounded to 2 decimal
places, is their Ranking Score (RS).

All teams participating in Qualification MATCHES are ranked by Ranking
Score. If the number of teams in attendance is 'n', they are ranked '1'
through 'n', with '1' being the team with the highest-Ranking Score and
'n' being the team with the lowest Ranking Score.

Teams are ranked in order, using the sorting criteria defined in [Table
10‑1]{.underline}.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Order     Criteria
  Sort      
  --------- -------------------------------------------------------------
  1^st^     Ranking Score

  2^nd^     Average ALLIANCE MATCH points, not including MINOR FOULS and
            MAJOR FOULS

  3^rd^     Average FUEL scored in AUTO

  4^th^     Average TOWER points

  5^th^     Random sorting by the FMS
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Qualification MATCH ranking criteria

## Playoff MATCHES

Playoff MATCHES follow the qualification MATCHES. In the Playoffs, teams
play on set ALLIANCES, chosen during ALLIANCE selection, and advance
through a double elimination bracket. Teams do not earn Ranking Points;
they advance based on winning, losing, or tying a MATCH.

A DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE, causes their
ALLIANCE to receive 0 MATCH points in a Playoff MATCH.

### ALLIANCE Selection Process

At the end of the Qualification MATCHES, the top 8 ranked teams become
the ALLIANCE Leads. The ranked ALLIANCES are designated, in order,
ALLIANCE 1, ALLIANCE 2, etc., down to ALLIANCE 8. Using the ALLIANCE
selection process described in this section, each ALLIANCE Lead chooses
2 other teams to join their ALLIANCE.

A break of 8 minutes (8:00) occurs between the posting of scores from
the last qualification match (scheduled or replay, whichever comes
later) and the start of the ALLIANCE Selection process for events that
host Alliance Selection shortly after QUALIFICATION MATCHES. At the end
of this break, ALLIANCE 1 is "on the clock" as defined below in
[T605]{.underline}.

601. **\*Send your STUDENT representatives.** Each team must choose and
     send a minimum of one and a maximum of three STUDENT team
     representatives. Representative(s) must report to the ARENA before
     the start of ALLIANCE Selection.

Violation: Team is ineligible for the Playoff Tournament if they are not
represented by the time they are announced.

If an absent team would have been an ALLIANCE Lead, all lower ranked
ALLIANCE Leads are promoted 1 spot.

The designated STUDENT representative from each ALLIANCE Lead is called
the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN (if the ALLIANCE has sent multiple STUDENT
representatives, they must designate only one as the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN).
This representative may change between ALLIANCE selection and Playoff
MATCHES.

602. **\*STUDENTS must outnumber adults.** A non-STUDENT may
     additionally be a representative from a team if the team has
     exactly two STUDENT representatives.

Violation: Non-STUDENT must leave the ARENA

These are the possible combinations of ALLIANCE Selection
representatives between [T601]{.underline}/[T602]{.underline}:

A.  One STUDENT

<!-- -->

B.  Two STUDENTS

C.  Three STUDENTS

D.  Two STUDENTS and one non-STUDENT

The ALLIANCE selection process consists of rounds during which each
ALLIANCE CAPTAIN invites a team ranked below them in the standings to
join their ALLIANCE. The invited team's representative must either
accept or decline the invitation immediately. If the team accepts, it
becomes a member of that ALLIANCE. This process results in 8 ALLIANCES
of 3 teams.

Each round is complete when all ALLIANCES have added one additional
team, and each round must be complete before the next round can begin.
In round 1 selections are made in descending order (ALLIANCE 1 to
ALLIANCE 8), whereas in round 2 selections are made in ascending order
(ALLIANCE 8 to ALLIANCE 1).

202. **\*** **Only STUDENTS may use the mic.** Only a single STUDENT
     from the invited team is allowed to accept/decline.

Violation: The team is assumed to have declined.

203. **\*** **Only the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN may invite an ALLIANCE.** The
     ALLIANCE CAPTAIN is the only representative of the ALLIANCE who may
     approach the emcee and make a valid pick via the microphone.

Violation: Pick does not count, and pick timer continues to count down.

204. **\*** **Picks are time limited.** Once the emcee requests an
     ALLIANCE'S selection, the ALLIANCE is considered "on the clock" and
     the pick timer begins to countdown. In round 1, the timer begins at
     45 seconds (0:45), in round 2 the timer begins at 1 minute and 30
     seconds (1:30). A sound will play to indicate that there are 5
     seconds left on the timer and a buzzer will go off to indicate the
     end of the time. The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN must make a good faith
     effort, as determined by the FTA or their designee, to state a
     valid team selection before the expiration of the pick timer.

Violation: The ALLIANCE is skipped, and the emcee moves to the next
ALLIANCE, unless the selection is the last of a round in which case the
ALLIANCE receives the next highest-ranked unselected team to the
ALLIANCE.

The time remaining on the pick timer is displayed on the FIELD timers.
Please note that audio cues are intended as a courtesy to participants
and not intended as official markers.

A valid team selection includes any team who has not yet accepted or
declined an invitation to join another ALLIANCE and is not an ALLIANCE
Lead that has had a pick timer violation. If an ALLIANCE CAPTAIN
attempts to select a team that is not valid, the pick timer continues to
run until it either expires, or a different (valid) team is invited to
join the ALLIANCE.

Examples of good faith efforts to state a valid team selection include
but are not limited to:

A.  Walking safely towards the emcee when the clock hits zero

B.  Starting to state a team as the clock hits zero

Examples that are not considered good faith efforts to quickly state a
valid team selection include but are not limited to:

O.  Continuing to talk with your ALLIANCE partners without moving
    towards the emcee

P.  Talking into the microphone for more than approximately 30 seconds
    without clearly stating a team number to invite

If an ALLIANCE CAPTAIN extends a valid invitation and the invited team
declines, the pick clock resets to the time for the designated round and
restarts immediately.

After each accepted ALLIANCE invitation or [T605]{.underline} violation,
the emcee invites any ALLIANCE CAPTAINS that received a
[T605]{.underline} violation in that round to make their selections.
Each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN may either indicate that they are ready to make
their selection (and immediately do so as determined by the FTA or their
designee) or indicate that they are not yet ready, and they will be
revisited after the next accepted invitation or [T605]{.underline}
violation. If a team with a [T605]{.underline} violation extends a valid
invitation and the invited team declines, they are allowed to make
another selection immediately or else they are skipped and will be
revisited as described above. If there are multiple ALLIANCE CAPTAINS
that have received [T605]{.underline} violations, they are revisited in
the same order in which they received their violations. If all remaining
teams in a round have received a [T605]{.underline} violation, each team
is revisited to either make a pick immediately or receive the next
highest-ranked unselected team.

The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN with the last selection of a given round may not be
the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN *scheduled* to have the final pick. For example,
imagine in round 1 that ALLIANCES 1-6 have all made valid selections and
ALLIANCE Lead 7 receives a [T605]{.underline} violation. If ALLIANCE
Lead 8 makes a valid selection, then ALLIANCE Lead 7 now has the final
selection of round 1.

A break of 2 minutes (2:00) occurs between each round of selections. At
the conclusion of the break, the ALLIANCE scheduled to make the next
selection goes "on the clock" and their timer begins per
[T605]{.underline}.

205. **\*Declining teams can't be picked.** An ALLIANCE CAPTAIN may not
     invite a team that has declined another ALLIANCE'S invitation to
     participate in the Playoff tournament. Declining teams are
     ineligible to be a BACKUP TEAM.

Violation: The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN must make another selection and pick
timer continues to count down.

When a team has declined, the team will show with a strikethrough on the
team number in the audience display.

Teams highlighted in orange (will become captain if not picked) will NOT
get a strikethrough if they decline as they can still become captains.

An ALLIANCE Lead that declines an invitation from another ALLIANCE is
able to invite teams to join their ALLIANCE but may not be invited to
join another ALLIANCE.

At the conclusion of ALLIANCE selection, the highest ranked unselected
teams are eligible to become a BACKUP TEAM, as defined in section
[10.6.3 BACKUP TEAMS]{.underline}.

### Playoff MATCH Bracket

The double elimination tournament consists of an Upper and Lower bracket
as shown in [Figure 10‑2]{.underline}. Each ALLIANCE begins with a slot
in the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE wins a MATCH in the Upper bracket,
they remain in the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE loses a MATCH in the
Upper bracket, they transition to the Lower bracket. ALLIANCES in the
Lower bracket must win any subsequent MATCHES (except for finals) to
remain in the tournament, i.e. once they lose a MATCH, they're out of
the tournament.

In Round 1, the higher ranked ALLIANCE is assigned to the red ALLIANCE.
For subsequent rounds, ALLIANCE color is assigned as shown in [Figure
10‑2]{.underline}. regardless of ALLIANCE rank at the start of the
Playoff tournament.

pairing)</p></figcaption>
</figure>

As shown in [Figure 10‑2]{.underline} and [Table 10‑2]{.underline},
Playoff MATCHES consist of 6 rounds with breaks between later rounds and
between Finals MATCHES. Breaks begin after the FIELD has been cleared
from the previous MATCH. The Blue and Red Gap columns indicate the
approximate time between each ALLIANCE'S MATCHES. The expected start
time of the scheduled MATCH is the time indicated on the MATCH schedule
or 15 minutes from the end of either ALLIANCE'S previous MATCH,
whichever is later. Occasionally, replayed MATCHES within a round may be
played out of order; if MATCHES are played out of order, teams are
informed by the emcee, FIELD STAFF, and/or queueing staff.

If a Playoff MATCH needs to be replayed as described in section [10.2
MATCH Replays]{.underline}, teams are notified of when the replay will
occur. A minimum 10-minute delay is provided for teams to reset their
ROBOTS prior to the replay unless all teams are ready sooner. The
affected MATCH must be replayed before the next round begins.

  : Playoff MATCH Tiebreaker Criteria

#### Playoff Finals

Once a single ALLIANCE remains in each Upper and Lower bracket, those
ALLIANCES proceed to the Finals round. The first ALLIANCE to win 2
MATCHES in the Finals becomes the event's Champions.

If a Finals MATCH ends in a tie score, the tie is not broken using the
criteria in [Table 10‑3]{.underline}, the MATCH remains a tie. In the
case where an ALLIANCE hasn't won 2 MATCHES after 3 MATCHES have been
played (because of tied MATCHES), the Playoffs proceed with up to 3
additional Finals MATCHES, called Overtime MATCHES, until an ALLIANCE
has won 2 Finals MATCHES. In the case where the Overtime MATCH scores
for both ALLIANCES are equal, the win for that Overtime MATCH is awarded
based on the criteria listed in [Table 10‑3]{.underline}.

### BACKUP TEAMS

During the Playoff MATCHES an ALLIANCE CAPTAIN may elect to replace one
of its ROBOTS. The team whose ROBOT and DRIVE TEAM replaces another
ROBOT and DRIVE TEAM on an ALLIANCE during the Playoff MATCHES is called
the BACKUP TEAM.

In this situation, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN has the option to bring in the
highest ranked team from the pool of available teams to join its
ALLIANCE for the following MATCH. The resulting ALLIANCE is then
composed of 4 teams.

ALLIANCES submit LINEUPS (as described in section [10.6.4
LINEUPS]{.underline} for each Playoff MATCH. After the BACKUP TEAM's
first Playoff MATCH, the ALLIANCE'S LINEUP may consist of any 3 of the
ALLIANCE'S 4 teams.

#### BACKUP TEAM Coupons

Each ALLIANCE is allotted 1 BACKUP TEAM coupon during the Playoff
MATCHES. If two or more ROBOTS from the ALLIANCE become inoperable, then
the ALLIANCE must play the following MATCHES with only 2 (or even 1)
ROBOTS.

Example: 3 teams, A, B and C, form an ALLIANCE going into the Playoff
MATCHES. The highest ranked team not on 1 of the 8 ALLIANCES is Team D.
During 1 of the Playoff MATCHES, Team C's ROBOT suffers damage to its
mechanical arm. The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN decides to bring in Team D to
replace Team C in the next MATCH. The new ALLIANCE of Teams A, B, C, and
D are successful in advancing to the Finals and win the event. Teams A,
B, C, and D are all recognized as members of the Winning ALLIANCE and
receive awards.

The Head REFEREE will not accept the BACKUP TEAM coupon unless it lists
the number of the team whose ROBOT is being replaced and is initialed by
the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN. Once a BACKUP TEAM coupon is submitted and
accepted by the Head REFEREE, the BACKUP TEAM coupon may not be
withdrawn by the ALLIANCE.

206. **\*No BACKUP TEAM for replayed MATCHES.** An ALLIANCE may not
     request a BACKUP TEAM for a replayed MATCH. The sole exception is
     if, in the judgment of the Head REFEREE, the replay is due to an
     ARENA FAULT that rendered an ALLIANCE'S ROBOT inoperable.

Violation: The request is denied.

207. **\*No BACKUP TEAMS for 1st MATCH.** An ALLIANCE may not request a
     BACKUP TEAM until after their first Playoff MATCH.

Violation: The request is denied.

208. **\*BACKUP TEAMS play when called.** A BACKUP TEAM must be included
     in the LINEUP for the ALLIANCE'S next MATCH following their
     recruitment.

Violation: The LINEUP is denied.

If the Head REFEREE is busy, and there is no designee, the ALLIANCE
CAPTAIN remains in the Question Box to report the LINEUP.

209. **\*BACKUP TEAMS due 2 minutes before the MATCH start time.** The
     BACKUP TEAM Coupon must be submitted to the Head REFEREE (or their
     designee) by the ALLIANCE CAPTIAN not later than 2 minutes before
     the expected MATCH start time in which the BACKUP TEAM is to play.

Violation: The request is denied

If the Head REFEREE is busy, and there is no designee, the ALLIANCE
CAPTAIN remains in the Question Box to submit the BACKUP TEAM coupon.

#### BACKUP POOL

After the top ranked ALLIANCE has made their final pick during ALLIANCE
Selection, the lead queuer (or their designee) polls the remaining
eligible teams. In rank order, the lead queuer (or their designee) will
invite remaining teams to accept or decline a position in the BACKUP
POOL, i.e. the group of teams willing and able to join an ALLIANCE
during the Playoff MATCHES, if needed, until up to 8 teams accept.

210. **\*Be there to be a BACKUP TEAM.** A team must be present after
     ALLIANCE Selection to accept the lead queuer's (or their designee)
     invitation to join the BACKUP POOL.

Violation: Team is ineligible to be a BACKUP TEAM.

211. **\*Send a BACKUP TEAM Representative.** The top 2 ranked BACKUP
     TEAMS must send at least 1 STUDENT representative (and optionally 1
     additional STUDENT or mentor) to a designated area near the FIELD
     for the duration of the Playoff MATCHES.

These 2 representatives are available to answer questions and accept
invitations to be a BACKUP TEAM from ALLIANCE CAPTAINS. If 1 of these 2
teams joins an ALLIANCE or excuses themselves from the BACKUP POOL, the
next highest ranked team in the BACKUP POOL must provide their
representative. Once a BACKUP TEAM has declined an invitation to join an
ALLIANCE, it is no longer a member of the BACKUP POOL and ineligible to
join another ALLIANCE.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING, plus the team is removed from BACKUP POOL if
the situation cannot be corrected within a reasonable amount of time.

Some events may offer an area near the FIELD where the top 1 or 2 teams
in the BACKUP POOL may choose to stage their ROBOT for quick and easy
access to the FIELD if recruited.

### LINEUPS

Each ALLIANCE competing in a Playoff MATCH has the option to submit a
LINEUP, which lists the 3 teams participating in the MATCH and their
selected DRIVER STATIONS.

The LINEUP is kept confidential until the FIELD is set for the MATCH at
which point each ALLIANCE'S LINEUP appears on the Team Signs.

#### LINEUPS for 4-team ALLIANCES

If an ALLIANCE has 4 members (either because a 3-team ALLIANCE has
called a BACKUP TEAM or the event is the *FIRST* Championship), a single
representative from the team not on the LINEUP is allowed as a sixteenth
ALLIANCE member but must be a member of that team's DRIVE TEAM. This
additional representative may only serve as a DRIVE COACH.

#### Default LINEUP

212. **\*LINEUPS due 2 minutes before the MATCH.** The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN
     must submit their LINEUP in writing to the Head REFEREE (or their
     designee) 2 minutes before their expected MATCH start time.

Violation: Late LINEUPS are denied, and the ALLIANCE'S most recent
LINEUP is applied.

If the Head REFEREE is busy, and there is no designee, the ALLIANCE
CAPTAIN remains in the Question Box to report the LINEUP.

If no previous LINEUP exists, the ALLIANCE Lead is assigned DRIVER
STATION 2, 1st team selected is assigned DRIVER STATION 1, and the 2nd
team selected is assigned DRIVER STATION 3. If any of these 3 ROBOTS are
unable to play, the ALLIANCE must play the MATCH with only 2 (or even 1)
ROBOT(s).

Example: 3 teams, A, B, and C form an ALLIANCE going into the Playoff
MATCHES. During one of the Playoff MATCHES, Team C's ROBOT becomes
inoperable. The ALLIANCE decides to bring in Team D to replace Team C.
Team C repairs their ROBOT and may play in any subsequent Playoff
MATCHES replacing Team A, B, or D

If a BACKUP TEAM Coupon is accepted and the LINEUP for the next MATCH is
not submitted or it omits the BACKUP TEAM, then the ALLIANCE'S most
recent LINEUP is used with the BACKUP TEAM in the position populated by
the team for whom they're substituting.

213. **\*For replays, no changing LINEUPS (mostly).** If a MATCH must be
     replayed due to an ARENA FAULT, the LINEUP for the replayed MATCH
     is the same as the original MATCH. The sole exception is if, in the
     opinion of the Head REFEREE, the ARENA FAULT rendered a ROBOT
     inoperable, in which case the LINEUP can be changed.

Violation: The new LINEUP is denied.

### Pit Crews

During the Playoff MATCHES and because of the distance between the FIELD
and the pit area, extra team members may be needed to maintain and
otherwise assist with the ROBOT between MATCHES. Each team is permitted
to have up to 3 additional pit crew members to help with needed ROBOT
repairs/maintenance.

### Small Event Exceptions

The scheduling algorithm described in section [10.5.2 MATCH
Assignment]{.underline} works to minimize teams playing in back-to-back
MATCHES. However, at events with fewer than 24 teams, back-to-back plays
may occur.

Multi-day events with 24 teams or fewer employ a modified Playoff MATCH
format. Instead of 8 ALLIANCES, these events proceed through ALLIANCE
SELECTION and the Playoff Tournament with the maximum number of complete
3-team ALLIANCES that can be formed while leaving at least 1 BACKUP TEAM
(e.g. a 24-team event creates 7 ALLIANCES, a 20-team event creates 6
ALLIANCES).

$$ALLIANCE\ count = \frac{team\ count - 1\ BACKUP\ TEAM}{3},\ rounded\ down$$

The Playoff Bracket remains as shown in [Figure 10‑2]{.underline} with
any matchup against a non-existent ALLIANCE resulting in a bye (i.e.
automatic advancement to the next round). An ALLIANCE assigned a
bye-MATCH is invited, though not required, to practice together in a
null MATCH (i.e. it has no bearing on the Playoff tournament) during the
designated time in the Playoff schedule.

District points for Draft Order Acceptance (per section [11.1.2 ALLIANCE
Selection Results]{.underline}) are awarded as if a full set of
ALLIANCES was selected (i.e. the 2^nd^ selection of the 3-seed ALLIANCE
still receive 3 points regardless of how many ALLIANCES are formed).

# District Tournaments

Teams advance through the season depending on the events at which they
compete: Regional or District. This section details how District teams
advance from District qualifying events to their District Championship.

## District Events

District teams are ranked throughout the season based on the points they
earn at the first 2 home District events they attend, as well as at
their District Championship. Points are awarded to teams as follows:

+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Category      | Points                                                |
+===============+=======================================================+
| Qualification | Normal distribution of points from 22 to 4 across the |
| Round         | highest ranked team to the lowest based on an         |
| Performance   | equation. See section [11.1.1 Qualification Round     |
|               | Performance]{.underline} for details.                 |
|               |                                                       |
|               | For a typically sized District event, this will       |
|               | result in a minimum of 4 points being awarded for     |
|               | Qualification round performance. For events of all    |
|               | sizes, a maximum of 22 points will be awarded.        |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| ALLIANCE      | Equal to 17 minus the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN number (e.g.   |
| CAPTAINS      | 14 points for ALLIANCE #3 Captain)                    |

: District Point Assignment

Points earned at District Championships are multiplied by 3 and then
added to points earned at District events, to determine the final season
point total for the team.

If there is a tie in the season point total between teams, the higher
ranked team will be determined using the following additional sorting
criteria:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Order   Criteria
  Sort    
  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
  1^st^   Total Playoff Performance Points

  2^nd^   Best Playoff Points at a single event

  3^rd^   Total ALLIANCE Selection Results Points

  4^th^   Highest Qualification Round Seed or Draft Order Acceptance
          (i.e. Highest ALLIANCE Selection points at a single event)

  5^th^   Total Qualification Round Performance Points

  6^th^   Highest Individual MATCH Score, regardless of whether that
          score occurred in a Qualification or Playoff MATCH

  7^th^   Second highest Individual MATCH Score, regardless of whether
          that score occurred in a Qualification or Playoff MATCH

  8^th^   Third highest Individual MATCH Score, regardless of whether
          that score occurred in a Qualification or Playoff MATCH

  9^th^   Random Selection
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : District Team Sort Criteria

### Qualification Round Performance

The calculation of Qualification performance points is done using the
equation below. This equation is an inverse error function which
utilizes the following variables:

- R -- the qualification rank of the team at the event at the conclusion
  of Qualification MATCHES (as reported by FMS)

- N -- the number of *FIRST* Robotics Competition teams participating in
  the Qualification rounds at the event

- Alpha (α) -- a static value (1.07) used to standardize the
  distribution of points at events

> $$\mathbf{QualificationPoints}\left( \mathbf{R,N,\alpha} \right) = \left\lceil \mathbf{InvERF}\left( \frac{\mathbf{N - 2R + 2}}{\mathbf{\alpha N}} \right)\left( \frac{\mathbf{10}}{\mathbf{InvERF}\left( \frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{\alpha}} \right)} \right)\mathbf{+ 12} \right\rceil$$

This formula generates an approximately normal distribution of
Qualification Round Performance points at an event, based on rank, with
most teams getting a moderate number of points, and fewer teams getting
the highest or lowest numbers of points available.

[Table 11‑3]{.underline} displays sample Qualification Round Performance
points for variously ranked teams at a 40-team event. The system will
automatically generate the appropriate points for each team based on
their rank and the number of teams at the event.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Rank     1    2    3    4    ...   19   20   21   ...   37   38   39   40
  -------- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----- ---- ---- ---- ----- ---- ---- ---- ----
  Points   22   21   20   19   ...   13   13   12   ...   6    6    5    4

  : Sample Qualification Round Point Assignments

### ALLIANCE Selection Results

This attribute measures both individual team qualification round seeding
performance and recognition by peers.

ALLIANCE CAPTAINS are recognized based on their qualification round
seeding rank. This rank is a result of the rules of the game, which
typically incorporate several team performance attributes, and are
designed to eliminate ties in rank. ALLIANCE partners are rewarded based
on peer recognition. To be invited to join an ALLIANCE, a team's peers
have decided that the team has attributes that are desirable. Giving
points for ALLIANCE selection also supports come-from-behind teams. A
team taking several MATCHES to optimize their performance may be
recognized as a late bloomer by a top seeded team, even if that
performance isn't reflected in the rankings because of poor performance
in early MATCHES. These points also have the potential to recognize
teams employing a unique strategy with their ROBOT. Teams with unique or
divergent ROBOT capabilities that complement the strengths of other
ALLIANCE members may be selected to fill a strategic niche.

Note also that ALLIANCE CAPTAINS are given the same number of points as
the team drafted in the same sequence. For example, the team who accepts
the pick from the third ALLIANCE CAPTAIN receives the same number of
points as the third ALLIANCE CAPTAIN. Numerical analysis supports the
idea that ALLIANCE CAPTAINS are about as strong in ROBOT performance as
equivalently drafted teams. An additional minor benefit to this system
is that it allows teams who would traditionally not be a top ranked team
the opportunity to be an ALLIANCE CAPTAIN.

### Playoff Performance

This attribute measures team performance as part of an ALLIANCE.

Teams that advance to at least MATCH 12 earn Double Elimination (DE)
Points per the formula below, where β is defined in [Table
11‑4]{.underline}.

$$DE\ Points = \frac{\#\ of\ DE\ MATCHES\ in\ which\ ALLIANCE\ won\ \&\ team\ participated}{\#\ of\ DE\ MATCHES\ the\ ALLIANCE\ won} \times \beta$$

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ALLIANCE Finish                                               β
  ------------------------------------------------------------- ---------
  1^st^ Place (Winners)                                         20

  2^nd^ Place (Finalists)                                       20

  3^rd^ Place (loser of MATCH 13)                               13

  4^th^ Place (loser of MATCH 12)                               7
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Double Elimination Points, β values

In most cases, unless a BACKUP is recruited, a team plays 100% of the DE
MATCHES won by their ALLIANCE, thus their DE Points simply equal β. If a
team does not play 100% of the DE MATCHES won by their ALLIANCE, their
DE Points equal their β value multiplied by the percentage of DE MATCHES
won by their ALLIANCE in which that team participated. If the result is
not a whole number, the value is rounded up to the nearest integer.

Teams on the winning ALLIANCE are awarded additional Finals Points,
which are 5 points for each Finals MATCH won and in which the team
participated, up to a maximum of 10 points.

For example, if Team X's ALLIANCE wins the event, but Team X only played
in 2 MATCHES won by their ALLIANCE, MATCH 13 and Final 1, Team X's
Playoff Performance points are 20 \* (1/5) + 5 = 9 points.

The maximum number of Playoff Performance Points a team can earn is 30
(20 DE points + 10 Finals Points).

### Team Judged Awards

This attribute measures team performance with respect to team awards
judged at the event.

The points earned for team awards in this system are not intended to
capture the full value of the award to the team winning the award, or to
represent the full value of the award to *FIRST*. In many ways, the
team's experience in being selected for awards, especially the *FIRST*
Impact Award, the Engineering Inspiration Award, and the Rookie All Star
Award (which is optional for District Championship events), is beyond
measure, and could not be fully captured in its entirety by any
points-based system. Points are being assigned to awards in this system
only to help teams recognize that *FIRST* continues to be "*More than
Robots^®^*," with the emphasis on our cultural awards, and to assist in
elevating award-winning teams above non-award-winning teams in the
ranking system.

Teams only receive points for team awards judged at the event. If an
award is not judged, is not for a team (e.g. the Dean's List Award) or
is not judged at the event (e.g. Safety Animation Award, sponsored by
UL), no points are earned.

### Team Age

This attribute recognizes the difficulty in being a rookie or relatively
new team.

Points are awarded to 2025 and 2026 rookie teams in recognition of the
unique challenges teams face in those early years, and to increase the
chance that they will make it to the District Championship to compete
with their ROBOTS. Like our dedicated Rookie awards, these additional
points are intended to recognize and motivate newer participants in
*FIRST* Robotics Competition. These points are awarded once at the
beginning of the season. Rookie year is calculated based on the year in
which *FIRST* recognizes the team as a rookie.

### Regional Participation

District teams neither earn points for their actions at any Regionals,
nor are eligible for any *FIRST* Championship qualifying benefits at
that Regional (awards, etc.).

## District Championship Eligibility

A team competing in a District qualifies for their District Championship
by meeting 1 of the following criteria:

A.  District *FIRST* Impact Award Winner,

<!-- -->

D.  District Ranking (based on total points earned at their first 2 home
    District events as detailed in section [11.1 District
    Events]{.underline}),

Teams do not earn points at third or subsequent District events, nor at
any inter-district or Regional events at which they compete during the
season.

If a team declines an invitation to the District Championship, the next
highest uninvited team on the list is invited, and so on, until the
event capacity is filled.

E.  District Engineering Inspiration winner (qualifies to compete for
    the award only), and

F.  District Rookie All Star winner (qualifies to compete for the award
    only).

The capacity of each District Championship is shown in [Table
11‑5]{.underline}. Each District determines the number of teams that
qualify for their District Championship. These limits are based on
factors including but not limited to the total number of teams in the
District, available venue capacity, etc.

  : 2026 District Championship Capacities

\* Due to the strong geographic concentration of teams in two main
regions of California, there are two separate District Championships,
but California will remain as one district. Teams in California can
compete and earn points in any District Qualifier event in California.
Teams are ranked based on the region they are located in (Northern or
Southern California) and advance to one of two District Championships.
The top 60 teams in each area (North and South) advance to their
District Championship.

## District Championships with Multiple Divisions

If a District Championship has too many teams to allow all teams 12
Qualification MATCHES, then the event hosts multiple divisions. These
events have 2 or 4 divisions (based on the number of teams
participating, see [Table 11‑5]{.underline}) with approximately 40--60
teams in each division. Teams are assigned divisions by *FIRST* using a
process developed by *FIRST* in Michigan and balances need for
accessible seating between Divisions.

The process employs a "brute force iterative randomizer" and is executed
as follows:

1.  The district team list is sorted in order of cumulative district
    points earned as described in section [11.1 District
    Events]{.underline}.

2.  The list is divided into quartiles based on rank (e.g. the first
    quartile has the top 25% ranked teams). If the total number of teams
    is not evenly divisible by 4 times the number of divisions,
    additional teams are distributed to quartiles 4, then 2, then 3.

3.  Division assignments are randomly generated using equal
    contributions from each quartile.

4.  3 criteria are calculated for each division:

    a.  average strength: the arithmetic mean of the district point
        values of teams in a division

    b.  distribution of strength: the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the
        district point values of teams in a division. SNR is calculated
        as follows:

$$SNR = 10\left( \log_{10}\frac{{\overline{x}}^{2}}{\sigma^{2}} \right){}$$

$\overline{x}$ = arithmetic mean of the district points in a division

σ = standard deviation of the district points in a division

c.  distribution of strength for "top" teams: The SNR of the district
    point values of teams in the first quartile of a division

<!-- -->

5.  The 3 criteria for each division are compared to the other
    division(s). If the difference between the division's value and any
    other division's value exceeds the limits in [Table
    11‑6]{.underline}, the criteria is not met.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                              2 divisions   4 divisions
  ------------------------------------------- ------------- -------------
  Average strength                            1             2

  Distribution of strength                    1             2.5

  Distribution of strength for "top" teams    1.5           2
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : District Championship division evaluation limits

6.  If all 3 criteria met, event organizers publish the assignments. If
    any of the 3 criteria are not met, assignments are rejected, and the
    process returns to Step 3.

## District Championship Playoffs

In these cases:

- Division winning ALLIANCES play each other in District Championship
  Playoffs, employing the brackets shown in [Figure 11‑1]{.underline}
  and [Figure 11‑2]{.underline} (and detailed in [Table
  11‑7]{.underline}) that corresponds to their District, until a winning
  ALLIANCE for the event is determined.

: District Championship 4-ALLIANCE Playoff MATCH schedule

*\* if required*

- Each team on a Champion ALLIANCE of a 2-Division District Championship
  Playoff tournament earns 10 points.

- For a 4-Division District Championship Playoff tournament, each team
  on a Champion ALLIANCE earns 20 points and each team on a Finalist
  ALLIANCE receives 10 points.

- If any of these ALLIANCES has recruited a BACKUP TEAM, these points
  are divided amongst the teams as described in section [11.1.3 Playoff
  Performance.]{.underline}

- If an ALLIANCE in a District Championship Playoff has not yet
  recruited a BACKUP TEAM per section [10.6.3 BACKUP TEAMS]{.underline},
  the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN may bring in only the highest ranked team from
  their division's BACKUP POOL to join its ALLIANCE.

## *FIRST* Championship Eligibility

Each District determines the number of Dean's List Finalists, *FIRST*
Impact Awards, Rookie All Star Awards, and Engineering Inspiration
Awards to present at their District Championship, within a range
established by *FIRST*. The team counts are based on the team
representation of the respective District at the Championship. For the
awards, ranges are developed by using ratios agreed upon by *FIRST* and
District Leadership. These ranges allow each District to represent their
own community as they see fit.

- For the *FIRST* Impact Award, the ratios range from one *FIRST* Impact
  Award team for every 18 Championship District teams to one FIRST
  Impact Award team for every nine Championship District teams.

- For the Dean's List Finalist Award, the ratios range from one Dean's
  List Finalist for every nine Championship District teams to one Dean's
  List Finalist for every six Championship District teams.

- All Districts, regardless of *FIRST* Championship Slot allocation, may
  award one or two Engineering Inspiration and Rookie All-Star Awards.

The following teams competing in the District model earn a Merit-Based
Qualifying slot:

- District Championship

  - *FIRST* Impact Award Winners

  - Engineering Inspiration Award Winners

  - Rookie All-Star Winners (the judges can decide if they present this
    award or not)

  - Winning Alliance members

- as many teams in District-points total order to fill the Allocated
  *FIRST* Championship slots granted per the table below.

Districts receive the percentage of \'available slots\' at *FIRST*
Championship, rounded up to the nearest whole slot, equal to the
percentage of teams they have in their District compared to the total of
all *FIRST* Robotics Competition teams. \'Available slots\' are
calculated by taking the total number of slots at *FIRST* Championship
and subtracting the number of pre-qualified teams. This overall
calculation uses a 'snapshot' of teams that have registered and paid as
of three weeks after initial season payment was due.

  : District FIRST Championship and awards allocations

\* Due to the strong geographic concentration of teams in two main
regions of California, there are two separate District Championships,
but California will remain as one district. Teams in California can
compete and earn points in any District Qualifier event in California.
Teams are ranked based on the region they are located in (Northern or
Southern California) and advance to one of two District Championships.
The top 46 teams from the entire District advance to *FIRST*
Championship.

# Regional Tournaments

Teams advance through the season depending on the events at which they
compete: Regional or District. This section details how Regional teams
advance from Regional events to *FIRST* Championship.

## Regional Events

Regional teams are ranked throughout the season based on the points they
earn at the first 2 Regional events they attend. Points are awarded to
teams as follows:

+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Category      | Points                                               |
+===============+======================================================+
| Qualification | Normal distribution of points from 22 to 3 across    |
| Round         | the highest ranked team to the lowest based on an    |
| Performance   | equation. See section [11.1.1 Qualification Round    |
|               | Performance]{.underline} for details.                |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| ALLIANCE      | Equal to 17 minus the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN number (e.g.  |
| CAPTAINS      | 14 points for ALLIANCE #3 Captain.) See section      |
|               | [11.1.2 ALLIANCE Selection Results]{.underline} for  |
|               | details.                                             |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Draft Order   | Equal to 17 minus the Draft Order Acceptance Number  |
| Acceptance    | (e.g. 12 points for the team that accepts the fifth  |
|               | draft position, regardless of whether it was delayed |
|               | per [T605]{.underline}.)                             |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Playoff       | Points awarded based on team participation in        |
| Advancement   | individual playoff rounds, and whether or not the    |
|               | ALLIANCE advances. See section [11.1.3 Playoff       |
|               | Performance]{.underline} for details.                |
+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Team Judged   | 45 points for *FIRST* Impact Award                   |

: Regional Point Assignment

If there is a tie in the event point total between teams, the higher
ranked team will be determined using the following additional sorting
criteria:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Order   Criteria
  Sort    
  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
  1^st^   Best Playoff Points at a single event

  2^nd^   Highest Qualification Round Seed or Draft Order Acceptance
          (i.e. Highest ALLIANCE Selection points at a single event)

  3^rd^   Best Qualification Round Performance Points

  4^th^   Highest Individual MATCH Score, regardless of whether that
          score occurred in a Qualification or Playoff MATCH

  5^th^   Second highest Individual MATCH Score, regardless of whether
          that score occurred in a Qualification or Playoff MATCH

  6^th^   Third highest Individual MATCH Score, regardless of whether
          that score occurred in a Qualification or Playoff MATCH

  7^th^   Random Selection
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Regional team sort criteria

### Team Judged Awards

This attribute measures team performance with respect to team awards
judged at the event.

Much of what is stated in section [11.1.4 Team Judged
Awards]{.underline} is also relevant to Regional events. Points are
assigned to awards to recognize that *FIRST* continues to be "More than
Robots^®^" and to elevate award-winning teams above non-award-winning
teams in the ranking system. These points are not intended to capture
the true value of these awards as that value is truly immeasurable.

Point values for some culture awards (*FIRST* Impact Award, Engineering
Inspiration) are higher for Regional events than District events because
Districts reward those teams with slots at an intermediate level of
competition: their District Championship. Regional teams do not have an
intermediate competition level and *FIRST* wants those teams to have an
opportunity to share their stories and celebrate their success outside
of their regional event.

### Team Age

This attribute recognizes the difficulty in being a rookie or relatively
new team.

Much of what is stated in section [11.1.5 Team Age]{.underline} is also
relevant to Regional events. Points are awarded to 2025 and 2026 rookie
teams. Unlike in the District events where these points are awarded once
per season, for Regional events these points are awarded at each event
they attend. Awarding these points at every event will assist rookies
with earning one of the three per-event qualification slots starting in
2026. Rookie year is calculated based on the year in which *FIRST*
recognizes the team as a rookie.

## *FIRST* Championship Eligibility

Regional teams can qualify for *FIRST* Championship in one of two ways:

1.  Direct Event Qualification

2.  Regional Pool

### Direct Event Qualification

At every regional event, teams earn points based on the point system.
Regional teams can earn points from and qualify directly for
the *FIRST *Championship at any Regional event they attend. The top x
number of teams who earned the most points at each event and who have
not already qualified for the *FIRST *Championship qualify for
the *FIRST *Championship.

- Each International event will advance 4 teams.

- Each US event will advance 3 teams.

Any team who wins the *FIRST *Impact Award at a Regional event and does
not qualify for *FIRST *Championship via a direct slot or from the
Regional Pool will be offered a remote interview to be eligible to win
at *FIRST* Championship. Teams who win the award and qualify for the
*FIRST* Championship must still attend the event in order to receive an
interview.

### Regional Pool

All Regional event teams not already qualified for the *FIRST*
Championship are ranked together in the "Regional Pool" based on the
points earned from their first two regional events. The top ranked teams
from this pool earn *FIRST *Championship qualification spots on a weekly
basis beginning after week 2. This list helps ensure the top performing
teams across events qualify for the *FIRST* Championship and allows for
the consideration of performance across multiple events for teams.
Awarding points at the first two events, with a projection if a team has
only played one event, rewards consistent performance over the season
without being punitive to single-event teams.

The global [[Regional Rankings
webpage]{.underline}](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/ra/) shows
all regional teams in rank order by their assigned points. Teams are
invited to the *FIRST* Championship from the Regional Pool on a weekly
basis beginning after Week 2.

Our goal is to release enough slots each week so that the same
proportion of Championship slots have been filled as events have been
completed. For example, if 35 of 56 (\~68%) Regional Events are
completed after Week 4, we plan to have approximately the same
percentage of Regional slots filled by that point.

#### Single-event team points calculation

If a team has only played one event at the end of the interval, they are
awarded second event points using this formula:

$$Second\ event\ points = 0.6*(first\ event\ points) + 14$$

This model is based on a regression of Event 1 vs Event 2 points in 2023
and 2024. This calculation projects how many points would be earned by
the average team who earned X points at their first event. If the result
is not a whole number, the value is rounded to the nearest integer.

# *FIRST* Championship Tournament (C)

At the 2026 *FIRST* Championship presented by BAE Systems, teams are
split into 8 divisions. The process used to assign teams to their
division is as follows:

1.  Teams requesting accessible seating are split amongst the divisions.

2.  Rookies are randomized and then assigned sequentially to divisions,
    skipping a division for each rookie assigned in Step 1 (i.e. a team
    in Division 1, a team in Division 2, a team in Division 3, a team in
    Division 4, a team in Division 5, a team in Division 6, a team in
    Division 7, a team in Division 8, then back to Division 1 again,
    until Rookies are all assigned to a division).

3.  Step 2 is repeated with veteran teams, with additional assignments
    as necessary to balance the total teams in each division.

Each division plays a standard tournament as described in section [10.5
Qualification MATCHES]{.underline} and section [10.6 Playoff
MATCHES]{.underline} to produce the division Champions. Those 8 division
Champions proceed to the Championship Playoffs, on the Einstein FIELDS,
to determine the 2026 *FIRST* Robotics Competition Championship Winners,
per section [13.4 FIRST Championship Playoffs]{.underline}.

## Advancement to the *FIRST* Championship

Details on how teams earn eligibility to attend the *FIRST* Championship
can be found in section [11.5 FIRST Championship
Eligibility]{.underline} and section [12.2 FIRST Championship
Eligibility]{.underline}. Teams that are pre-qualified can be found on
the [[*FIRST* Championship eligibility
webpage]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/championship-eligibility-criteria).

## 4-ROBOT ALLIANCES

There is no provision for BACKUP TEAMS at the *FIRST* Championship.

Instead, before each division Playoff Tournament, ALLIANCES are selected
per the process as described in section [10.6.1 ALLIANCE Selection
Process]{.underline}, however the process continues with a third round
of selection as follows.

**Round 3:** The same method is used for each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN'S third
choice except the selection order is reversed again, with ALLIANCE 1
picking first and ALLIANCE 8 picking last. This process results in 8
ALLIANCES of 4 teams each.

ALLIANCES may start with any 3 of the 4 ROBOTS on their ALLIANCE during
division Playoff MATCHES and during the Championship Playoffs. ALLIANCES
submit LINEUPS for their MATCHES as described in section [10.6.4
LINEUPS]{.underline}.

## *FIRST* Championship Pit Crews

*FIRST* distributes buttons to the ALLIANCE CAPTAINS during the ALLIANCE
CAPTAIN meeting, which takes place on the division FIELDS. These buttons
provide the necessary access to the ARENA for pit crew members.

301. **\*Wear your buttons.** Only team members wearing proper buttons
     are allowed on the ARENA floor during division and Playoff MATCHES.

Violation: MATCH won't start until the situation is corrected. Those not
displaying identification must leave the ARENA.

Teams should assume they may be chosen for an ALLIANCE and think about
the logistics of button distribution and set a plan prior to the
ALLIANCE selection process. It is each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN'S responsibility
to distribute buttons to their pit crew members.

## *FIRST* Championship Playoffs

The 8 division Champions play a Double Elimination style tournament as
described in section [10.6 Playoff MATCHES]{.underline} to determine the
2026 *FIRST* Robotics Competition Champions. Exact MATCH timing is
provided to *FIRST* Championship Playoff teams. ALLIANCES are paired as
shown in [Figure 13‑1]{.underline}.

<figcaption><p>FIRST Championship playoff bracket</p></figcaption>
</figure>

During the Einstein Finals, if the MATCH score of each ALLIANCE is
equal, the MATCH is replayed. In this circumstance, the LINEUP may be
changed.

# Event Rules (E)

The rules below apply throughout an event, i.e. from when Load-In begins
to when Load-Out is complete.

Additional rule specific violations, if applicable, are listed with
their corresponding rule.

Universal Violation Note: A violation of any Event Rule will result in a
VERBAL WARNING. Egregious or subsequent violations will be addressed by
the Head REFEREE, the Lead Robot INSPECTOR (LRI) and/or Event
Management. Teams should note that egregious and frequent violations may
be shared with the Judge Advisor which could lead to disqualification
from awards.

*FIRST* is committed to [[*STEM for
Everyone*](https://www.firstinspires.org/about/stem-for-everyone)™]{.underline}
and as such, *FIRST* strives to make reasonable accommodations for
persons with disabilities that request accommodation. If a participant
needs an accommodation for an event, we ask that they talk to a
volunteer at the event or contact their [[local
leadership]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/find-local-support)
before the event so they can ensure the request is addressed.
Accommodations are considered reasonable if they do not create an undue
hardship, cause safety concerns, or fundamentally alter the nature of
the event.

Rules around safety and security within this section are minimum
requirements, and Program Delivery Partners are able to implement
increased restrictions due to local or venue requirements (e.g.
requiring badging for all attendees, reserving seating for
accessibility, etc.). Partners should communicate additional local
requirements early enough to allow teams to plan.

Safety is always paramount, and many rules are intended to establish
norms at each event that will mitigate injury risk to all participants.

Event staff have the final decision authority for all safety-related
issues within a venue.

## General Rules

101. **\*Personal safety comes first.** All team members must observe
     the following safety practices throughout the event:

<!-- -->

A.  wear safety glasses (only ANSI-approved, UL Listed, CE EN166 rated,
    AS/NZS certified, or CSA rated non-shaded) while in and around the
    playing FIELD and in the pit area. Lightly tinted lenses are
    permitted provided eyes are clearly visible to others, but
    reflective lenses are prohibited. Accommodations will be made for
    participants that require tinted safety glasses. The only exception
    is for teams in their first 10 minutes of their load in and for the
    first 10 minutes pits are open each day of the event as long as
    they're not working on the ROBOT or setting up their pit.

<!-- -->

I.  wear closed toed/heeled shoes.

J.  tie back long hair while working on or around a ROBOT or ROBOT
    related materials.

K.  wear appropriate clothing.

L.  walk in the venue

M.  health and safety requirements in place for that event (e.g. mask
    wearing).

For more information about safety at *FIRST* Robotics Competition
events, please reference the [[Safety
Manual]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/resources/library/safety).

102. **\*Be nice.** All participants must be gracious and professional
     at all times while attending *FIRST* Robotics Competition events.
     Uncivil behavior toward any participants is not tolerated.

Examples of inappropriate behavior include, but are not limited to

A.  use of offensive language or other uncivil conduct,

<!-- -->

Q.  intentionally blocking the view of other participants or spectators
    for an extended period (team members momentarily holding up team
    signs while directly supporting their team is not considered a
    violation of this rule.), and

R.  jamming or interfering with the remote sensing capabilities of a
    ROBOT or the FIELD while in open-access spectator seating areas.

Examples of remote sensing capabilities include, but are not limited to,
vision systems, acoustic range finders, sonars, and infrared proximity
sensors.

Use of imagery that, to a reasonably astute observer, mimics the
AprilTags employed on the FIELD is a violation of this rule.

Examples of particularly contemptible behavior that may result in
ejection from the event include, but are not limited to, the following:

A.  assault, e.g. throwing something that hits another person (even if
    unintended),

<!-- -->

S.  threat, e.g. saying something like "if you don't reverse that call,
    I'll make you regret it,"

T.  harassment, e.g. badgering someone with no new information after a
    decision's been made or a question's been answered,

U.  bullying, e.g. using body or verbal language to cause another person
    to feel inadequate,

V.  insulting, e.g. telling someone they don't deserve to be on a team,

W.  swearing at another person (versus swearing under one's breath or at
    oneself), and

X.  yelling at another person(s) in anger or frustration.

<!-- -->

103. **\*Children with adults, please.** Children under 12 must be
     accompanied in the pits by an adult at all times.

104. **\*Respect the venue.** Teams may not damage the venue, including
     but not limited to bleachers, floors, walls, railings, etc., in any
     way.

105. **\*Teams must check in.** An adult team member must check in at
     the Pit Administration station no later than 90 minutes before
     Qualification MATCHES are scheduled to start.

Violation: Teams will be contacted in their pit. Failure to Check-In may
result in a team not participating in the event.

Event check-in takes place at the Pit Administration station the evening
before and/or the first morning of each event.

Once a team's consent and release forms are submitted at Pit
Administration, each team will receive their DRIVE TEAM & Safety Captain
buttons.

106. **\*Some event resources for event teams only.** Only teams
     registered for an event may use that event's Competition FIELD,
     Practice Areas, Spare Parts, Machine Shop, and Inspection. Host
     teams supplying TEST/PRACTICE AREA elements and/or Machine Shop
     resources may use them, however teams registered for that event
     must be granted priority.

107. **\*Work in designated areas only.** At the event venue, teams may
     only produce FABRICATED ITEMS as follows:

<!-- -->

A.  in their pit area,

<!-- -->

N.  in another team's pit area with permission from that team,

O.  while queued for a MATCH or TEST/PRACTICE AREA (given space
    constraints, extra scrutiny regarding safety is required),

P.  any area designated by Event Staff (e.g. Playoff Pit Area, etc.), or

Q.  as permitted at provided machine shops that are available to all
    teams.

ROBOTS are permitted to be powered on while in queue. ROBOTS which are
powered on, but not enabled, such as to deploy code, require minimal
additional precautions. Teams enabling their ROBOT, such as to charge
pneumatics or test system functions, should ensure that they are
maintaining safe space for any mechanism on the ROBOT to move
unexpectedly to its full extent.

108. **\*Some things don't belong at events.** Do not bring or use the
     following:

<!-- -->

A.  skateboards

<!-- -->

R.  'hoverboards'

S.  drones

T.  bottled gas tanks (e.g. helium)

U.  noisy devices or noisemakers, such as floor stompers, whistles
    and/or air horns

V.  walkie-talkies

W.  scooters, except for those used for accommodations

X.  any item with bright lights which flash faster than approximately 5
    times per second

<!-- -->

109. **\*Don't arrange for additional utilities.** Do not arrange for
     power, internet access, or phone lines from venue service providers
     or attempt to use venue internet connections reserved for event
     purposes (e.g. the FIELD Management System or web casting).

110. **\*Don't sell stuff.** Teams may not conduct sales at an event.
     This includes, but is not limited to, raffle tickets, food, hats,
     shirts, candy, water, soft drinks, fruit, or any promotional
     products.

111. **\*Don't give out food.** Teams may not distribute food to others
     at an event.

112. **\*Make *FIRST* loud, but with restrictions.** Do not invite or
     bring live bands to play in the audience. Do not play loud music.

113. **\*Hang banners with care.** Be respectful when hanging your
     banners.

<!-- -->

A.  Do not cover or move other team or sponsor signs already in place.

<!-- -->

Y.  Share the available space fairly with other teams.

Z.  Do not obstruct the view of spectators.

A.  Get permission from the Event Coordinator before hanging banners
    outside of your pit.

B.  Hang signs and banners in a safe manner.

C.  Banners hung outside team pits must not be larger than 25ft^2^
    (2.3m^2^).

We encourage teams to bring team flags and/or signs for display in their
pits and/or the playing FIELD area.

To find your Event Coordinator, inquire at the Pit Administration desk.

Respect venue-specific rules regarding sign location and hanging
methods. At the end of the event, safely remove all signs and anything
used to hang the signs (tape, string, etc.).

114. **\*Limit flag and flagpole size.** Flags and flagpoles may not be
     of unreasonable size and weight.

As a guideline, reasonable flags are less than 36.0in by 60.0in (91.44cm
by 1.524m) in size and weigh less than 2.0lb (0.91kg). Reasonable
flagpoles may not be more than 96.0in (2.438m) long and weigh less than
3.0lb (1.4kg).

115. **\*No firearms.** Firearms are prohibited at all *FIRST* events
     for all *FIRST* programs, including without limitation, [[all
     official *FIRST* Events posted
     here]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/team-event-search#type=events).
     This policy does not apply to law enforcement or venue security
     personnel.

116. **\*Only COTS batteries allowed.** Teams may only bring COTS
     batteries to events. Output wires or connectors may be modified as
     long as no safety systems are compromised.

Violation: Teams will be asked to remove or not bring in the batteries.

117. **\*Do not record anyone at the event without their consent.** Do
     not record interactions with anyone at an event, without the
     person's consent. *FIRST* event staff and volunteers are empowered
     to excuse themselves from an interaction in which they are being
     recorded after declining consent.

Please note that many *FIRST* events are livestreamed and *FIRST*
participants have given permission to appear in footage from *FIRST*.
This does not mean that people can record specific interactions without
additional consent.

Laws regarding recording of conversations vary state-to-state and
country-to country, and, in some cases, recording without consent may be
criminal. Introducing the idea of recording a conversation with an
implied reason of proving someone's error can escalate a discussion and
is likely to increase its adversarial nature.

118. **\*Enter only 1 ROBOT.** Each registered *FIRST* Robotics
     Competition team may enter only 1 ROBOT (or "robot," a ROBOT-like
     assembly equipped with most of its drive base, i.e. its MAJOR
     MECHANISM that enables it to move around a FIELD) into a 2026
     *FIRST* Robotics Competition Event.

"Entering" a ROBOT (or robot) into a *FIRST* Robotics Competition means
bringing it to or using it at the event such that it's an aid to your
team (e.g. for spare parts, judging material, or for practice).

While "most of its drive base" is a subjective assessment, for the
purposes of this rule, an assembly whose drive base is missing all
wheels/treads, gearboxes, and belts/chains is not considered a "ROBOT."
If any of those COMPONENTS are incorporated, the assembly is now
considered a "ROBOT."

This rule does not prohibit teams from bringing in ROBOTS from other
*FIRST* programs for the purposes of awards presentations or pit
displays.

## Machine Shops

Some events host a machine shop, open during specific hours (see the
event's agenda), to help teams with repair and fabrication of their
ROBOT. Machine shops are typically sponsored by NASA or local
organizations. While the machine shops vary, *FIRST* strives to have
welding and a variety of high-powered tools available at all events.

In most cases, the machine shop is on site and readily accessible to all
teams. If a team attends an event where the Machine Shop is off-site,
volunteers are in place to transport the ROBOT or parts to and from the
machine shop. In this case, a team fills out a Machine Shop Request Form
that travels with the ROBOT or parts, so the machine shop staff and
volunteers can follow their directions. The event should set up a method
of communication between the venue and off-site machine shop in case
there are any questions.

201. **\*The ROBOT goes alone to off-site machine shops.** Team members
     may not travel to off-site machine shops with the ROBOT being
     transported by volunteers.

Teams may travel to the off-site machine shop on their own, either by
walking or using their own vehicle, but all STUDENT team members must be
accompanied by an adult at all times. Teams should strongly consider
including a third team member per [[the *FIRST* Youth Protection Program
guidelines]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/youth-protection-program).

## Wireless Rules

301. **\*No wireless communication.** Teams may not set up their own
     802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax/be wireless communication (e.g. access points
     or ad-hoc networks) in the venue.

A wireless hot spot created by a cellular device, camera, smart TV, etc.
is considered an access point.

Some smart TVs have access points enabled by factory default. Please
make sure that functionality is disabled for any TVs brought to the
event.

119. **\*Don't interfere with wireless networks.** Participants may not
     interfere, attempt to interfere, or attempt to connect with any
     other team or *FIRST* wireless communication except as expressly
     allowed for purposes of communicating with their team's ROBOT on
     the FIELD or TEST/PRACTICE AREA.

Teams are encouraged to report suspected wireless security
vulnerabilities to the *FIRST* Technical Advisor (FTA) if at the event
or to *FIRST* via [<customerservice@firstinspires.org>.]{.underline}

Violation: Subsequent violations may lead to dismissal from event and/or
legal action based on applicable laws.

120. **\*Tethered operation outside FIELDS/PRACTICE AREAS.** ROBOTS may
     only be operated by tether when outside the FIELD or PRACTICE AREA.

## Load-In

Events set specific time frames, published on the event's schedule, in
which teams are invited to load their ROBOT and equipment into their pit
areas before pits officially open. At a typical District qualifier,
events have pits open and load in marked as the same time on the public
agenda and thus some of these rules will not apply. At most District
Championships and most Regionals, there are typically load in periods
without pits being opened and thus these rules do apply.

Load-In can be stressful for teams and volunteers, which can be
mitigated by preparation and planning. Unanticipated factors, like
traffic or weather, can change a team's scheduled arrival time, making
the process difficult. The most important things a team should remember
are to be safe, gracious, and professional.

401. **\*Load in during Load-In.** Teams must load in the ROBOT and all
     ROBOT elements into the event by the end of the last designated
     Load-In period on the Public Schedule. Exceptions are as follows:

<!-- -->

A.  raw stock

<!-- -->

D.  OPERATOR CONSOLES, BUMPERS, battery assemblies

E.  COTS items with minor modifications (attachment of connectors,
    assembly of COTS items per manufacturer instructions, labeling or
    decoration, etc.)

F.  3D printed parts

G.  gearboxes attached to associated motor(s)

H.  exceptional circumstances that result in a team not being able to
    make the Load-In time and has made arrangements with Event
    Management.

Public Schedules can be found in the additional info section via the
[[Team & Event
Search]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/team-event-search).

There are no rules that explicitly restrict items that may be brought
into the venue during the designated Load-In period. During Load-In,
teams are not limited to a single trip, and are encouraged to be as
efficient and safe as possible.

Violation: Item will not be permitted into venue.

121. **\*Load-In person limit is 6.** Only 6 team members (one of which
     must be an adult) may be in the pit area during any Load-In period
     prior to pits opening.

Violation: Extra team members must leave the venue.

122. **\*Load-In Restrictions.** The only team permitted activities
     during load in periods prior to pits opening are:

<!-- -->

A.  bringing materials into their pit area,.

<!-- -->

I.  ROBOT and BUMPER weighing (if available at your event), including
    any necessary BUMPER installation or removal, and

J.  Early Pit Setup (if available at your event).

Violation: Teams will be asked to leave the pit area.

123. **\*Pit must be left in a safe state.** Teams must have their pits
     in a safe state by the time pits close (even if some tasks are left
     undone).

124. **\*Once done, head out.** Unless assisting other teams, teams must
     leave the venue once finished delivering materials (or, in the case
     of Early Pit Setup, when setup is complete) prior to pits opening.

If an event has designated Early Pit Setup times both the evening before
and the morning before pits officially open, a team may use both periods
for Load-In and setup, but per this rule must leave once pit setup is
complete.

Violation: Teams will be asked to leave the pit area.

## Pits

A team pit is the designated space, usually 120.0in by 120.0in by
120.0in (3.048m x 3.048m x 3.048m), where a team may work on their
ROBOT. Each team is assigned a pit space marked with their team number.
This helps team members, judges, and visitors find teams easily. Each
team pit has a power outlet and a table may be provided.

Teams, volunteers, *FIRST* staff, and guests spend a lot of time in the
pits. Get to know other teams and help each other when you can. Time is
short and help is very often right \"next door\" in the adjacent team
pits.

Small, bench-top machinery, with appropriate guards, is permitted in
team pits. 'Small' machinery is machinery that can be easily lifted by
one person and examples include, but are not limited to, small band
saws, drill presses, desktop CNC mills, and sanders.

501. **\*Pits are unavailable if closed.** Teams may not be in their
     team pit outside the designated pit hours.

<!-- -->

125. **\*Stay in your pit.** Teams should set up their allowed equipment
     fully within their assigned pit space. Teams may not:

<!-- -->

A.  run power or internet lines from their team pit to any other area
    except as instructed or allowed by the event,

<!-- -->

K.  swap team pits with other teams, or

L.  move themselves to empty team pits without approval.

<!-- -->

126. **\*Keep aisles clear.** Aisles must be kept clear.

127. **\*No sparks or flames.** Tools that throw sparks or produce open
     flames are prohibited.

Examples of tools that violate this rule include, but are not limited
to, welders, bench and angle grinders, gas torches, etc.

128. **\*Nothing too big.** Floor standing power tools are prohibited.

Examples include but are not limited to full-size drill presses, band
saws, and table saws.

Violation: Teams will be asked to remove or not bring in floor standing
power tools. Any items that are deemed unsafe or outside specifications
by FIRST personnel, event management, and/or local committee members
must be removed.

129. **\*No brazing or welding.** Brazing/welding is prohibited.

Violation: Teams will be asked to remove or not bring in brazing/welding
tools. Any items that are deemed unsafe or outside specifications by
FIRST personnel, event management, and/or local committee members must
be removed.

130. **\*Solder with specific tools only.** Soldering may be done using
     an electric iron/gun only.

Violation: Any items that are deemed unsafe or outside specifications by
FIRST personnel, event management, and/or local committee members must
be removed.

131. **\*Structures must be safe.** Teams may not build any structure
     that supports people or stores items overhead.

Violation: Any pit structures that is deemed unsafe or outside
specifications by FIRST personnel, event management, and/or local
committee members must be removed.

132. **\*Secure team identification assets.** Team signs, flags, and
     displays must be securely mounted to the pit structure.

Violation: Any pit structures that is deemed unsafe or outside
specifications by FIRST personnel, event management, and/or local
committee members must be removed.

133. **\*No automated tools overnight**. Teams may not run a 3D printer
     or other automated manufacturing process overnight in the pit.

134. **\*Pit Power Limit.** Power to team pits is often shared between
     multiple teams. Team pits that are causing breakers to trip may be
     asked to reduce power consumption.

## TEST AREAS and PRACTICE AREAS

*FIRST* Robotics Competition events have TEST AREAS. TEST AREAS are
areas at events where teams can test their ROBOT with representative
FIELD elements. Teams may also be able to test their starting AUTO modes
but they are not designed for multiple SCORING ELEMENT AUTO modes or
full FIELD play. TEST AREAS are tether-only. FUEL is not provided and if
a team wishes to practice with FUEL, they must bring their own.

*FIRST* provides a recommended layout, but events may need to tweak
exact placement depending on the space available in the venue. Teams may
not relocate elements from their original locations. The layout is
specifically intended to discourage testing of complex AUTO routines.

*FIRST* provides a small set of production run AprilTags for the TEST
AREAS. The tags provided for the 2026 TEST AREA will include tags 2, 5,
8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16. Teams that wish to use other AprilTag
IDs for the TEST AREA may print copies of other tags to bring to events
but should not remove the provided tags. Printable copies of the field
AprilTags can be found on the [[Playing FIELD
webpage]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/resources/library/frc/playing-field).
Teams may temporarily cover up the provided tags (e.g. with a blank
sheet of paper) to prevent their vision systems from reading nearby tags
unintentionally.

HUMAN PLAYERS are welcome to practice throwing FUEL into the TEST AREA
HUB as long as the area around the HUB is clear of other ROBOTS and
humans to avoid missed shots hitting people or interfering with ROBOT
testing. Priority is given to ROBOT practice over HUMAN PLAYER practice.
Teams choosing to practice throwing FUEL must bring their own FUEL.

Although some events may also provide PRACTICE AREAS, many do not have
the space or resources to provide long full FIELD interactions. PRACTICE
AREAS are defined as areas with a full FIELD. Some District
Championships and *FIRST* Championship may choose to run a full Field
Management System on the PRACTICE AREA which allows them to connect
robots wirelessly. For events that have full FIELDS but are using
tether, teams should expect that 2 teams are allowed on half the field
at a time. Practice Attendants may allow additional teams provided teams
are a safe distance from one another.

601. **\*Inspection for TEST & PRACTICE AREAS.** A team may only use the
     designated TEST AREAS and PRACTICE AREAS with a ROBOT that has
     passed an initial, complete inspection.

602. **\*Practice only when/where permitted.** Teams may only practice
     with their ROBOT in their pit space, in the designated event TEST
     AREAS, PRACTICE AREAS, or while in a Practice MATCH.

Teams may not set up their own practice equipment outside their pit.
When practicing in their pit, safety must remain the top priority. If
Event Management determines a pit practice setup is unsafe or interferes
with activity in adjacent pits or aisles, the team must discontinue the
activity.

135. **\*TEST/PRACTICE AREA attendance is limited.** Only team members
     actively working on the ROBOT are allowed to be at the
     TEST/PRACTICE AREA.

The intent of this rule is to limit the number of people directly next
to ROBOTS that are enabled. The recommendation is no more than 5 members
per team, but some events may limit further due to available space.

Teams may have additional team members watching from a distance,
provided the venue has space, but those members should be a safe
distance from all ROBOTS operating at the TEST/PRACTICE AREA.

136. **\*Give ROBOTS space.** When using a tether on TEST AREAS and
     PRACTICE AREAS, teams must keep a safe distance from all ROBOTS and
     moving elements and must not interact directly with the ROBOT when
     it is enabled.

Generally, a safe distance is \~72.0in (\~1.83m) from the ROBOT.

137. **\*Be ready to DISABLE.** Teams must be ready to DISABLE their
     ROBOT if the ROBOT does not move in the desired direction or in
     case of safety.

138. **\*Be safe.** [G102]{.underline} and [G103]{.underline} also apply
     at the TEST AREAS and PRACTICE AREAS.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. TEST/PRACTICE AREA suspension if subsequent
violations during the event.

## ROBOT Carts

Most teams use carts to transport their ROBOT throughout an event. Carts
are not required but are strongly recommended (to minimize risk of
muscle strains, dropped ROBOTS, and other hazards). In addition to the
rules listed below, teams are strongly encouraged to put the team's
number on the cart, refer to the [[*FIRST* Safety
Manual]{.underline}](https://www.firstinspires.org/resources/library/safety)
for ROBOT lifting techniques, and practice putting the ROBOT on and off
the cart to develop a safe, quick, fluid routine.

701. **\*Carts must be safe and easy to use.** Carts must be easy to
     control, maneuver, and pose no risk to bystanders.

<!-- -->

139. **\*Carts shouldn't be too big.** Carts must fit through a standard
     30.0in (76.2cm) door.

140. **\*Carts can't park anywhere.** Carts must remain in the team pit
     (or cart staging area if during a MATCH) when not in use.

141. **\*No noisy carts.** Carts may not be equipped with music or other
     sound-generating devices, except for devices of reasonable volume
     used for safety purposes (e.g. to make others in the vicinity aware
     that a ROBOT is on the move).

142. **\*No motor driven carts.** ROBOT carts may not use powered
     propulsion.

143. **\*Small ROBOT carts are allowed on the FIELD**. ROBOT carts
     smaller than 30.0in (76.2cm) by 36.0in (91.4cm) may be brought onto
     the FIELD to aid in staging and retrieving the ROBOT provided they
     are not left unattended and do not pose any other safety hazards.

## Ceremonies

At every event, there are Opening and Closing Ceremonies to show honor
and respect for represented countries, sponsors, teams, mentors,
volunteers, and award winners. Ceremonies provide everyone with the
opportunity to collectively applaud the successes of all participants.
They also give teams a chance to \"meet\" the volunteers and other
people and sponsors involved with the event. Closing Ceremony elements
at the end of the event are integrated into and presented between
Playoff Matches.

At the Awards Ceremony, *FIRST* presents trophies and medallions to
outstanding teams. All team members are encouraged to attend the
ceremonies, be punctual, and show appreciation to volunteers that
staffed the event.

801. **\*If in the pits during Ceremonies, shhhhhh.** During Ceremonies
     outside of Playoff MATCHES, team members may not:

<!-- -->

A.  use power tools,

<!-- -->

M.  use loud hand tools (hammers, saws, etc.), or

N.  shout, yell, or use loud voices, unless as a demonstration of
    approval during a ceremonial activity.

<!-- -->

144. **\*Pit person limit during Ceremonies is 5.** No more than 5 team
     members may be in the pits during Ceremonies outside of Playoff
     MATCHES.

145. **\*Be respectful during anthems.** Team members, including any
     remaining in the pits, should exhibit peaceful behavior during the
     presentation of all national anthems. Traditionally, team members
     stand to face the flag, remove hats, and either sing along or
     maintain a respectful silence during the anthems of all nations
     present at the event. If team members wish to abstain, they have a
     right to do so, as long as they remain silent and non-disruptive.

## In the Stands

901. **\*No saving seats.** Teams are not permitted to save or designate
     seats for team members that are not present.

Teams may not hang banners or ribbons or otherwise designate seating.
(Event staff will remove and discard any banners, roping, etc., used to
designate seating.) Please take turns sitting in the bleachers/stands if
seating is limited. If there is a crowding problem, we ask that you
kindly leave after your team\'s MATCH and return later, if possible.

Event management may reserve seats for attendees who require
accommodations.

146. **\*Don't throw items from the stands.** Items may not be thrown
     from audience seating.
