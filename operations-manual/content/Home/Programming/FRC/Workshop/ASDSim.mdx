# Absolute Sensor Discontinuity Simulator

This interactive tool helps you understand and visualize how absolute encoder discontinuity points work in FRC robotics, specifically following the CTRE sensor discontinuity pattern.

## What is Sensor Discontinuity?

When using absolute rotational sensors (like CANcoders), the sensor output wraps around at a configured "discontinuity point". This tool lets you explore:

- **Physical Turret** - The actual mechanical rotation (0-360°)
- **Hard Stop** - The mechanical constraint region where the turret cannot rotate
- **Wrap Point** - The software discontinuity where sensor readings "jump" from 1.0 to 0.0
- **Safety Check** - Whether your wrap point is safely inside the hard stop

## How to Use

1. **Drag the blue dot** on the Physical Turret to rotate the sensor manually
2. **Adjust the Discontinuity slider** to move where the sensor wraps around
3. **Watch the Software Output graph** to see how the sensor value changes
4. **Aim for SAFE** - The red dashed line (wrap point) should be inside the grey hard stop zone
