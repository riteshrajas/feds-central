# PID Motor Control Simulator

Configure and simulate PID, feedforward, and gravity compensation gains for FRC motor controllers.

## Understanding Motor Control

This simulator helps you visualize how different control gains affect system behavior.

### Simulation Modes

- **Arm Simulation**: See how gains affect rotational mechanism with gravity
- **Turret Simulation**: Control horizontal rotation with no gravity

### Control Types

- **PID**: Proportional, Integral, Derivative feedback control
- **Feedforward**: Pre-calculated voltage commands (kS, kV, kA)
- **Gravity Compensation**: kG for holding against gravity

## Getting Started

1. Choose between Arm and Turret simulation
2. Switch between slots to compare different configurations
3. Adjust gains incrementally and observe the system response
4. Use the target control to test tracking performance

## Tips for Tuning

- Start with kP = 1.0, everything else = 0
- Increase kP until you get oscillation, then back off
- Add kD to reduce overshoot
- Use kS/kV for smooth feedforward
- Tune kG to hold position
