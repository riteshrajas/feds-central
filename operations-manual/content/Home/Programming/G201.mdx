# G201 Calculator

The **G201 Calculator** is an eco-friendly assessment tool designed by FRC Team 201 to help other robotics teams evaluate and reduce their environmental impact.

## Purpose

The calculator provides a structured way to track sustainability metrics across four key modules:
1.  **Shipping & Packaging**: Tracks materials used in ordering and packaging.
2.  **Disposable Meal Items**: Evaluates waste from team meals and events.
3.  **Robot Components**: Assesses material usage in robot construction (mechanical, electrical, etc.).
4.  **Transportation**: Measures carbon footprint from team travel.

## How It Works

Users answer a series of questions in each module. The calculator computes an "Eco Score" based on:
-   Quantity of materials used.
-   Disposal methods (single-use vs. recyclable).
-   Transportation efficiency.

Based on the score, the tool provides **personalized recommendations** to help the team become more sustainable.
