  **Before We Begin**: You don't need to be a math genius or a computer wizard. You just need curiosity and a willingness to break things (digitally, please not the physical robot... mentors get sad when the robot breaks).

## 🏗️ Chapter 1: The Tools of the Trade

Before we code, we need... well, code editors. And libraries. And maybe a snack.

### Essential Installations

<ZTH1Grid2 />

---

## 🎨 Chapter 2: Creating a Robot Project

Open VS Code (hit the W icon).
Press the magic WPILib button (top right, looks like a W).
Type "Create a new project".
Select "Template" -> "Java" -> "Command Robot".
**STOP!** Why "Command Robot"?
Because "Timed Robot" is like writing an essay in one long paragraph. "Command Robot" is like organizing it with headers, bullet points, and memes. It's just better.

## 📝 Chapter 3: Naming Conventions (Or: How to Not Get Yelled At)

In programming, names matter. If you name a motor , nobody will know what it does. If you name it , everyone is happy.

## 💻 Chapter 4: Writing Your First Code

We will start with the most exciting thing in robotics: **Making a motor spin!**

### Step 1: Define the Subsystem
A "Subsystem" is a physical part of the robot (Drivebase, Arm, Intake).

```java
public class DriveSubsystem extends SubsystemBase {
    // 1. Define hardware
    private final PWMSparkMax leftMotor = new PWMSparkMax(0);
    private final PWMSparkMax rightMotor = new PWMSparkMax(1);

    // 2. Define methods (actions)
    public void setMotors(double leftSpeed, double rightSpeed) {
        leftMotor.set(leftSpeed);
        rightMotor.set(rightSpeed);
    }

    public void stop() {
        leftMotor.set(0);
        rightMotor.set(0);
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Create a Command
A "Command" is an action (Drive Forward, Shoot Note).

```java
public class DriveForwardCmd extends Command {
    private final DriveSubsystem driveSubsystem;

    public DriveForwardCmd(DriveSubsystem subsystem) {
        this.driveSubsystem = subsystem;
        addRequirements(subsystem); // Important! Tells robot "I am using the wheels!"
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        driveSubsystem.setMotors(0.5, 0.5); // Drive at 50% speed
    }

    @Override
    public void end(boolean interrupted) {
        driveSubsystem.stop();
    }
}
```

## 🎮 Chapter 5: Controller Input

Robots are cool. Robots you can control with an Xbox controller are cooler.

```java
// In RobotContainer.java
private final CommandXboxController driverController = new CommandXboxController(0);

private void configureBindings() {
    // When 'A' button is held, run the intake
    driverController.a().whileTrue(new RunIntakeCmd());

    // Default command: Drive with joysticks
    driveSubsystem.setDefaultCommand(
        new RunCommand(
            () -> driveSubsystem.arcadeDrive(
                -driverController.getLeftY(),
                -driverController.getRightX()
            ),
            driveSubsystem
        )
    );
}
```

## 🤝 Chapter 6: Team Programming Etiquette

Coding on a team is different from coding alone. You can't just delete everything because you feel like it.

<ZTH1Grid4 />

## 🧠 Checkpoint

You've survived Episode 1! You now know:

<ZTH1Grid5 />

In **Episode 2**, we'll dive deeper into the Command-Based framework and learn how to make the robot do multiple things at once (without exploding).

**Keep coding, keep learning, and remember: every expert was once a beginner who refused to give up!** 🚀

*P.S. - If your robot starts talking back, that's either very advanced AI or you need more sleep. Probably more sleep.* 🤖💤
