## Subgroups

To support your learning journey, we have a variety of subgroups that focus on different aspects of robotics. These include:

<Cards>
    <Card title="Programming" href="/Programming/Tools&Setup" icon={FaCode()}>
        The programming subgroup focuses on developing the software that controls the robot. Members learn programming languages like Java and C++ and work on autonomous routines and driver controls.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Electrical" href="/Electrical/Tools&Setup" icon={FaPlug()}>
        The electrical subgroup is responsible for designing and wiring the electrical systems on the robot. Members learn about circuits, sensors, and power distribution.
