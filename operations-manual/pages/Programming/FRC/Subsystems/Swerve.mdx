# Drive Base

Our team predominantly uses CTR's Serve Drive System for our drive base. This system is a robust and reliable system that has been used by many teams in the past.

## Components

The drive base consists of the following components:

- **Motors**: We use Falcon Kraken x60 motors for our drive base.
- **Wheels**: We use 4-inch diameter wheels for our drive base.
- **Encoders**: We use CTRE CANcoders for our drive base.

    In order to use CTRE's Swerve Drive System, you will need to have CTRE's Motors, Encoders, and Pigeon IMU.
