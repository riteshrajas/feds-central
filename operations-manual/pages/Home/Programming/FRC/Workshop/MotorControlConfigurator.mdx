# Motor Control System Configurator

Configure and simulate PID, feedforward, and gravity compensation gains for FRC motor controllers.

## Understanding Motor Control Gains

### PID Gains

- **kP (Proportional)**: Responds to position error. Higher values = faster response
- **kI (Integral)**: Accumulates error over time. Helps eliminate steady-state errors
- **kD (Derivative)**: Responds to rate of change. Reduces overshoot

### Feedforward Gains

- **kS (Static Friction)**: Voltage to overcome static friction
- **kV (Velocity)**: Voltage per unit velocity
- **kA (Acceleration)**: Voltage per unit acceleration

### Gravity Compensation

- **kG (Gravity)**: Voltage needed to hold position against gravity

## How to Use

1. Select "Arm" or "Turret" simulation mode
2. Choose an active slot (0-1)
3. Adjust gains with sliders
4. Move target control to see system response
