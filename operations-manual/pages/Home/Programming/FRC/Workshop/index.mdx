# FRC Workshop Simulators

Welcome to the FRC Programming Workshop! This folder contains interactive simulators to help you understand critical FRC concepts.

## Available Simulators

### 1. **Absolute Sensor Discontinuity Simulator** (`ASDSim`)
Learn about absolute encoder wrap points and how to safely configure them.

- **Explore**: Where sensors "wrap" around in their range
- **Visualize**: Physical turret position vs software output
- **Understand**: Hard stops and discontinuity points
- **Optimize**: Find the safe configuration for your mechanism

**Key Files**: `ASDSim.mdx` → `Components/Programming/ASDSimulator.jsx`

---

### 2. **Motor vs Mechanism Ratio Simulator** (`MotorVsMechanism` or `MvMSim`)
Understand gear reduction and its effects on speed, torque, and control.

- **Explore**: How rotor, sensor, and mechanism speeds relate
- **Visualize**: Multi-stage gear train animations
- **Graph**: Position traces for all three components
- **Experiment**: Adjust ratios to see real-time effects

**Key Files**: `MotorVsMechanism.mdx` / `MvMSim.mdx` → `Components/Programming/MotorVsMechanismSimulator.jsx`

---

### 3. **Motor Control System Configurator** (`MotorControlConfigurator` or `PIDSim`)
Tune PID, feedforward, and gravity compensation gains.

- **Configure**: PID coefficients (kP, kI, kD)
- **Feedforward**: Static friction (kS), velocity (kV), and acceleration (kA) gains
- **Gravity**: Compensation for different mechanism types
- **Simulate**: Arm or Turret control modes
- **Slots**: Store 4 different configurations for different control modes

**Key Files**: `MotorControlConfigurator.mdx` / `PIDSim.mdx` → `Components/Programming/MotorControlConfigurator.jsx`

## How to Use the Simulators

### Starting Out
1. Begin with **Motor vs Mechanism Ratio** to understand gear reduction
2. Move to **Motor Control System** to see how gains affect behavior
3. Finally, **Sensor Discontinuity** to ensure safe configurations

### For Competition
- Use **Motor Control System** to quickly test different gain sets
- Reference the gains that work best in your code
- Use **Sensor Discontinuity** when configuring absolute encoders

### For Learning
- Experiment with extreme values to see effects
- Try oscillate vs continuous modes
- Compare different slot configurations
- Test both Arm and Turret modes

## Technical Notes

- All simulators are **interactive React components**
- Canvas-based rendering for performance
- Real-time physics approximation
- No external dependencies (uses React hooks only)
- Dark theme optimized for learning environments

---

## File Organization

Each simulator follows this pattern:
- **MDX File** in `Workshop/` - Contains documentation and imports component
- **React Component** in `Components/Programming/` - Interactive simulator logic
- **Default exports** - Compatible with Nextra MDX system

---

## Next Steps

- Read the documentation for each simulator
- Experiment with different parameters
- Export your preferred configurations
- Compare results between simulators

Happy learning! 🚀
