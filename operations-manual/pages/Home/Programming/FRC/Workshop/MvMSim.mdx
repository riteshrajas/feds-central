# Motor vs Mechanism Ratio Simulator

This interactive simulator helps you understand the relationship between rotor speed, sensor speed, and mechanism speed through gear ratios.

## Understanding the Chain

In FRC mechanisms, power flows through multiple reduction stages:

1. **Rotor (Motor)** - The motor shaft spinning at full speed
2. **Sensor** - An encoder that reads rotor position, reduced by the first gear ratio
3. **Mechanism** - The actual output (arm, elevator, etc.), further reduced by the second ratio

## Key Concepts

- **RotorToSensorRatio**: How much the motor speed is reduced before the sensor sees it
- **SensorToMechanismRatio**: How much the sensor speed is reduced to produce the final mechanism output
- **Total Reduction**: The product of both ratios

## How to Use

1. **Choose a motion mode**: Oscillate for back-and-forth motion, or Continuous for spinning
2. **Adjust the gear ratios** using the sliders or number inputs
3. **Watch the visualization** to see how each component rotates
4. **View the graph** to compare position traces over time
