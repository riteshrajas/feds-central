## Welcome to Team 201: The FEDS!

Welcome to Team 201: The FEDS! We hope you will find your experience very rewarding and enjoyable. This guide is intended to give you and your parent/guardian an understanding of the program and the required responsibilities. In the following pages you will find information relating to team rules, expectations, and many other aspects of our team and FIRST.

As a FIRST Robotics member, you have an incredible opportunity to gain knowledge and share your enthusiasm while growing into future Business, Technology, and Engineering Leaders. You will participate in a life changing experience, and have the opportunity to learn many skills that will help you in your future, from networking with other teams and gaining sponsorships to designing and building a robot to our own specifications to working as a fully functional team with a varied group of people.

The success of Team 201 in robotics and its numerous other activities is due to the dedication of our members (this includes our Students, Mentors, and Parents) acting as a TEAM. Your participation is essential to fulfilling our program's goals. Every member's commitment and responsibility keeps our team running smoothly. The possibilities are only limited by your engagement and enthusiasm. We encourage you to have an abundance of both!

## Understanding FIRST

**FIRST** (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) was founded by inventor Dean Kamen to inspire young people's interest and participation in science and technology. FIRST is volunteer-driven and built on partnerships with individuals, businesses, educational institutions, and government. Some of the world's most respected companies provide funding, mentorship time, talent, and equipment to make FIRST's mission a reality.

### FIRST Program Levels
- **LEGO League Explorer** (K-3 grades)
- **LEGO League Challenge** (4-5th grades)  
- **FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)** (6-8th grade)
- **FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)** (High School)

These programs are high-tech spectator sports that combine the excitement of competition with real-world engineering challenges.

## FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition)

Our team operates year-round. During summer and fall, we conduct training, outreach activities, team building activities and fundraisers. The FRC competition season typically starts at the end of February and lasts for eight weeks. Team 201 will participate in a minimum of two Michigan District competitions during the regular season.

Each year FRC unveils a new challenge at kickoff in January. High school students work with professional mentors to solve the engineering design problem and then join other teams in alliances to play the game at competition events where they are judged on design, innovation, and performance. Students learn teamwork, acquire technical skills, develop business acumen, and discover strengths they never knew they had. The program is a life-changing, career-molding experience and it's a lot of fun. Be competitive and play hard on the field, but it is much, much more than a game.

## Team Structure & Sub-teams

Every member needs their role. Every role contributes to team success.

<TeamStructureGrid />

### Detailed Sub-team Functions

**Programming Group**
Uses software provided by FIRST to create a program that allows the robot to perform various tasks and functions – both autonomously and by human control. Also builds the interface between the controls and the robot, with input and agreement between the users who will be interacting with the controls, and the mentors.

#### Build Sub-Groups

**Mechanical Group**
Responsible for prototyping, assembly, testing, and repair of the robot.

**Machining Group**
Responsible for manufacturing customized parts for the robot using the machine shop and its equipment.

**Electrical Group**
Responsible for wiring all motors, compressors, talons, solenoids, etc. The wires shall be labeled and neatly arranged for ease of maintenance. Board layout and packaging must be worked out with the Mechanical group.

#### People & Culture Subgroups
